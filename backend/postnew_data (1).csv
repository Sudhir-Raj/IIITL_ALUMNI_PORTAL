Firstly, an apprenticeship  program is one of the best investments a firm can make - U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that companies with apprenticeship programs earnt a return on investment of $1.46 for each dollar invested.

Employers that sponsor migrants under the new temporary skill shortage visa and certain permanent skilled visas will be required to pay a levy which will provide revenue to the Fund.

 5 Simple Steps To An Effective ART Strategy,art,845077288,"After decades of corporate reform in our public schools, the results are in. And it's not good news for the reformers.  On the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is the only assessment nationally normed and administered, this year' results showed stagnation over prior years tests, and increases in gaps between the highest-performing students and the lowest. The evidence rolls in persuasively that administering more and more assessments - diagnostic, district, state, and now nationally - in an effort to increase test scores - with the added costs and consequences of higher class sizes and fewer classes in #education #reform #gap the arts and humanities - have resulted in no improvement in reading or math scores.  It's time to stop the testing madness, and time to return to what engages our learners in our schools...it sure isn't more testing and more test preparation.

OPERATING SYSTEM And Love - How They Are The Same,operating system,815794757,"It's pouring outside here in Gloucester MA.  And, I am worried about Thanksgiving, a holiday that many see as a Hallmark card (although it rarely is.) I looked at the data on Canada as their Thanksgiving predates ours; it led to a rise in cases.   https://lnkd.in/eu9BWky . Then, I saw images of our airports now in anticipation of the holiday, and it makes me realize that the next month leading up to the New Year may be a total disaster in terms of illness and deaths. We aren't listening to scientists/medical experts. Too many are gathering and celebrating in groups; we're defying what would save lives -- wearing masks and social distancing. I have a forthcoming piece in New England Journal of Higher Education explaining non-compliance as it relates to young people (high schoolers and college students).  But, I haven't written about adult non-compliance (yet).  What are we thinking?  Is it the same thinking that let's us think that there was massive election fraud that accounts for the Trump loss?  We don't want to believe truth?  We don't want to believe science?  We don't want to believe voters and election monitors?  Sad to say:  we seem to disregard that with which we don't agree -- despite truth to the contrary. That's scary.  On every front.

 Take 10 Minutes to Get Started With PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,403170667,"Despite the upbeat news on the vaccines, I think we are struggling mightily across the nation with three key issues: (1) Pandemic fatigue including Zoom fatigue; (2) Absence of interpersonal touch and connectivity; and (3) Upcoming holidays and ""tradition"" changes that distance us.  In a sense, the second ""surge"" feels, at least to some of us, worse than the first surge; the numbers are perilously high; we have a dysfunctional transition of power (whatever your political persuasion) that is harming our nation. Some of us have become more isolated than perhaps even necessary due to fear as others flaunt mandates and best practices.   In a sense, we are unaccustomed and unprepared for what is happening in our nation.  We can rightly ask: how do we move forward with grace and wisdom and perspective?  What compensatory mechanisms can we deploy to help all those who need help? And, what about our children and their ability to navigate forward?   I have one thought: I have hope.  I still believe despite some evidence to the contrary that people are decent and caring and at the end of the day, the better side of humanity and the wiser voices will rise to the top and be seen and heard.  I still have hope.   Do you?

 World Class Tools Make DRAWING Push Button Easy,drawing,722885880,"Some of the aphorisms we repeat are oft-times not true.  And, it's important to recognize that reality and we need to stop repeating certain phrases as if they represented the truth.  Take this phrase: Time heals all wounds. That's just false. It heals some wounds and ameliorates others. But there are some wounds from which we don't recover fully; we navigate forward; we learn work-arounds. But time doesn't eliminate the trauma we've experienced.   Try this phrase: Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me. How false is this? Imagine racial slurs and other affronts.  We need to take abusive language seriously; words do hurt and do harm. Goodness, how can we treat verbal abuse as non-hurtful?   My point is this: we easily repeat phrases without truly reflecting on their meaning. What better time than now, in the midst of a pandemic, racial tensions and uncertainty, to reflect on these referenced phrases and eliminate them from our lexicon. And, these are not the only two phrases that deserve to be set aside. Let's help our children by recognizing that traumatic events are not erased and words can do harm. If we recognize this, we can be in a position to help others in schools and workplaces and communities. P.S. Diamonds are not a girl's best friend.

We need to understand the outbreak. Was it a player or two (or more) who went rogue in Atlanta without permission and/or protection?  Where did they go?  Was it transmitted on the plane through personnel on board or in the aircraft filters somehow?  Was it at any of the hotels with breaks in protocol for hotel workers?  Was it families of players or hotel or flight workers? I say “hit the pause bottom“ on conclusions and extrapolations until we know more. Yes, that assumes truth will rise to the surface.

 2 Ways You Can Use SCIENCE To Become Irresistible To Customers,science,785311173,"Final update on my contretemps with my alma mater Smith. I’m treating the college as if she were my mother (mater), hoping she’d change her ways and listen. Hopeless for Smith and my mother.   I give up.  They just don’t get the issues I raise; they are unresponsive; they make promises but can’t deliver. They fail to work openly on student psychosocial needs post COVID.   The Smith president focuses on new library (looks lovely ) and a new Culture of Care (w/o attention to impact of COVID on psyche of students). With a well regarded School of Social Work, Smith should know better.  The president has never seen fit to contact me (I am a former college President after all and not uneducated!).   Ironic that Smith has never had one of its own as president, only Seven Sister with that distinction.  Decades ago I was pushed by alums to apply for Smith presidency when Ruth Simmons went to Brown. I got a call from a headhunter, not Smith’s, after another person was chosen.  She said “I know 2 things about you. You have a non-traditional resume for a college president and you made it further than any Smithie in history of Smith.” Guess Smithies aren’t good enough for their alma mater, like some daughters aren’t good enough for their mothers.

 Here Is A Quick Cure For MATHEMATICS,Mathematics,995620623,"Here's another update on my contretemps w/ Smith and the notification of its creation of the Culture of Care but without ANY reference to psychosocial wellbeing.  Oxymoronic.  In any event, I had an excellent phone call w/ the head of Mental Health and I must say, it was surprisingly good.  She listened well.  I had 5 questions to probe regarding what they were or weren't doing. She responded to each and indicated to whom she would forward information or try to make inroads. She indicated that she thought there would be a new email on the import of mental wellbeing soon. She did not exhibit arrogance or dismissal of an alum's ideas. She was open and receptive.  That said, the proof is in the proverbial pudding. Will her words turn into institutional action?  The acid test.  We will have to wait and see. If there is prolonged radio silence, then I will reach back and know that the words were just that: words only.  On the other hand, if I see movement forward in tangible ways, I will share that too.   It is easy to talk; it is harder to act. I eagerly await the next steps -- and am willing to say at present that I have more than a glimmer of hope that there will be some improvements/additions/changes to benefit students' return experience to the campus at my alma mater, Smith.

 Don't Be Fooled By CRAFT,Craft,816250803,"I was just asked by an online pub. to predict what will happen in higher education in the coming years.   I had to fight the question. At best, predictions are based on facts and data and science and studies and experience in the trenches.  Even then, predictions are fraught with uncertainty.  Gamblers know that.  So, after pointing out the non-homogenous nature of higher ed and the absence of consistent change, I suggested that it was vastly better to provide conjectures rather than predictions.  The world is changing so fast; we’re in unknown territory.  I suspect we don’t have all the data and what data we have may be flawed. It is for these very reasons that we feel anxious and stressed and a tad (or more) out of sorts. We have no control; we have no gold at the end of the rainbow; we have an absence of certainty.  And it’s not like the messaging from our governments is consistent. The inability to predict is actually our problem. We can’t and therein lies the disquiet.  So, in response to the editor’s questions, I won’t make predictions. Instead, I’ll conjecture.  Watch for a later  post where I conjecture about higher ed.   One caveat: I can predict that most elite schools will not be on the frontline of innovation/change.  They can afford to do neither. That’s sad.

5 Brilliant Ways To Use BANKING,banking,282811398,"Perhaps someone can explain Amazon pricing to me.  I have a new book on trauma. It’s cover is below. Sadly, it is a book that is needed now, particularly as we reflect on reopening schools and colleges, all of which should at least aim to be trauma responsive.

 Why I Hate PAINTING,painting,699000487,"I wanted to update my contretemps w/ my alma mater.  I observed, w/ anger and disappointment, that the new Culture of Care plan for fall students didn’t mention mental health, trauma responsiveness or even trauma. It only addressed physical safety, important tho that is. W/ the President copied, the head of mental health services shared the many mental health programs Smith has.  She shared recent hires.  She shared ongoing connections w/ students during the Covid-gap. Unfortunately, the response was fraught w/ generalities. While it noted trauma training of staff, there was no mention of trauma training for faculty. The response didn’t address why the Culture of Care failed to mention mental health. And the response did not share how they would help students, faculty and staff at the start of the new semester; they didn’t mention a trauma responsive plan or approach.  It was typically Smith-like: kind words at beginning and end and self aggrandizement in the middle.  Does Smith have nothing to learn about restarting?  I wrote back, noting the omissions. Smith has trained women to think well. Being that I’m Smith educated, why do they take me for a fool?  Smith’s lack of openness to improvement and its self-satisfaction is pitiful. Doesn’t speak well for my alma mater.

 Here's A Quick Way To Solve A Problem with HR MANAGEMENT,HR management,349675800,"For those of you who couldn't attend the live book launch on June 22, TC Press has released a video taped during the launch. It's a wonderful panel. Enjoy!"
 Want More Money? Start MUSIC,Music,286244235,"Help me here. My alma matter wrote a plan creating a “culture of care” regarding reopening. But, it was silent on mental health issues. No recognition of the psychological toll of Covid, racial tensions and massive uncertainty about the future.   The President of Smith has not answered my concerns, and I’m an alum. Think about this: all reopening schools need to focus on trauma and create themselves as trauma responsive institutions. It is critical to learning and culture and future success.  I have written about this. I have done webinars on this. I have a book dealing with this (newly released):  https://lnkd.in/eCgEc8J .  It is what I do and I remain prepared  to help ALL our children... I guess Smith College will remain distant and yet again, miss the proverbial boat.   My hope for other colleges and schools and businesses:  Take a lead here; do the opposite of Smith.  Introduce trauma responsiveness when you reopen.  Even some micro efforts help. So will concrete strategies raised in my book that can be replicated, transported and adapted. See that there is a clear connection between physical and mental wellbeing.  Reopen in ways that recognize the psychic toll of the last few months.  As to Smith, listen to their continued silence.  Then speak up and out — loudly.

12 Questions Answered About FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,979382730,"My alma mater Smith is failing its students. The college is not alone.  Here’s why:  The Smith president sent an email describing with pride their culture of care in reopening.  It basically described detailed approaches to physical safety with a couple other things tossed in including reference to race initiatives.   Where oh where was any reference to psychological wellbeing of students and trauma they have experienced of late?  Shouldn’t they include trauma responsiveness in any proposal related to care?  Are Smithies immune somehow from trauma?  Where is the effort to add mental health professionals to handle primary, secondary and vicarious trauma? Staff and faculty training?   A culture of care cannot ignore mental health.  Smith and other institutions are failing to understand how returning to campus will feel amidst a pandemic, racial tension, economic uncertainty, confusion and strife, political division, familial dysfunction (latter happens in elites too).   Smith has, yet again, missed the boat.  It’s a boat that’s not hard to see.  Yipes.

 5 Surefire Ways ZOOLOGY Will Drive Your Business Into The Ground,zoology,387174115,"Random (or not so random) thoughts: My computer died. Perhaps writing a new book wore it out.  Wore me out too.  Being without my computer feels debilitating.  But, I will have new computer w/ data transfer I hope by Thurs.  Somehow, despite my cell phone’s potential, I can’t use it to write or do PowerPoints or edit.   I have an article to post on Medium but it won’t post from my cell; Medium refuses to recognize my identity.  Piece is on reopening schools/colleges. Another update:  I’d been following Amanda Kloots’ posts about her husband Nick Cordero who was in ICU for 91 days and died Sunday. She had hope. I feel a loss, not because I know Nick Cordero personally (many know him from Broadway/TV).  But, I believed in his capacity to fight Covid. He didn’t go gently into that goodnight. And I appreciate anger is rising among us.  I’m extra mad at my alma mater Smith. They emailed alums that they had a culture of care for returning students. It focused on physical safety, impt to be sure.  But, not a word on psychological wellbeing and institutional preparedness for traumatized students. Smithies are immune?  Smith never paid attention to me (many stories there). They wouldn’t know or care that I wrote a book on trauma and student success, helpful for reopenings. Hum.

 The A - Z Guide Of GST,GST,824146428,"Seems so odd to “celebrate” our nation when it is plagued with the pandemic, racial tensions, unemployment and cross-sector uncertainty.  It would be like celebrating a person’s birthday who is struggling with depression.   Here’s another oddity:  I wrote a book on the impact of trauma on children and their education.  That was written pre-pandemic although it was edited to include the pandemic during the page proof stage.  It does deal with racial and sexual discrimination and micro aggressions.   The book’s efforts to create trauma responsive institutions has added and new meaning, augmenting its import. Sadly, Trauma Doesn’t Stop at the School Door is a book for our time.  And it can help, which gives me solace. Amazon book stock is running low but there’s an ebook discounted.  Teachers College Press has the paperback and ebook (also discounted).  Perhaps the book will give you hope; it does that for me. For the 4th, hope is a good theme.  Better perhaps than fireworks.

 Top 10 Tips To Grow Your BANKING,banking,828768220,"Just  got a snarky comment to comment I made on IHE about a term I used.  The term was “empathy engine activation;” the comment was akin to:  “never use those words referring to students.” Ponder engines of empathy....the longer term for empathy engines, right?   This commenter (initials PC) misunderstands the term empathy engine and assumes it is anti-human; it is the opposite.  I could just say google.  But instead, I want to focus on why this term is so important and so apt and so central to human engagement.   Empathy is a key quality in humans and for developing human engagement. We often don’t  show empathy.  So we need to make sure empathy can be generated — activated.  An engine is not a negative term.  It is like a generator.  Think about the phrase “engines for change” — a good descriptor.  Demeaning “engines” demeans engines as if they were “just” for mechanics and mechanics aren’t worthy. Pooh bah. Engines are amazing.  We are human engines. Activation is a positive word.  Look at first three letters:  ACT.  The key is to not just talk about empathy but actually make it live in people.  To return to the phrase I used: We want to activate empathy engines.  Seems wise to me.  And necessary.  And valuable.   Thoughts? Anyone like mirror neuron activation better?

 Can You Pass The BANKING Test?,banking,115440046,"The Land O’Lakes controversy has left me puzzled. The female image was done by a Native American artist. And what product had a Native American woman front and center — and not in a demeaning way?   Except ..... here’s what I recall as a teenager lo those many years ago that made me cringe and I thought that was why the image was removed.  If you bent the box (empty) a certain way, the woman’s knees became her breasts and she was sitting there with nothing covering her breasts.  Yipes.  Hadn’t the company realized that little and not so little boys were making a sexual display and a mockery of a Native American woman on their box?   Then decades later, when the image was to be removed, I thought: “Finally, someone smart knew about the knees/breasts swap and they are fixing it at ling last.”  Frankly it could have been corrected by a slight change in her clothing and she did not need to be removed. She did need to stop being the fantasy of young boys.  Back then, seeing breasts was a big deal — kind of like Playboy or Penthouse, neither of which seem needed with the Internet and the 60’s .... Was I dreaming this?  Chime in.  Why is no one mentioning it? Just google and there are stories and even demonstrations.  Why has this been ignored?  Or pushed under proverbial rug?

 Why DRAWING Is The Only Skill You Really Need,drawing,694855149,"We seem to have many holidays, celebrating everything from the festive to the sad. May 1 was College Signing Day (meant to be positive) and many were using the phrase and hashtag Happy College Signing Day. Now I believe in college (in a nuanced way) and I was a college president. But, yesterday was not a Happy College Signing Day. There is and was way too much uncertainty and concern. Even for those with a June 1 Signing Day (namely making a deposit -- it used to be non-refundable), these are times when college choice is not clear at all for students and their families -- in terms of location, safety, approaches to learning (in person, brick and mortar or hybrid), decisions without visits, possible gap years.  Bottom line, the holiday made no sense yesterday: Happy College Signing Day should have been canceled. Or, was it intended to be ironic?

 The Single Most Important Thing You Need To Know About PAINTING,painting,654560551,"Here's an edited version of the response I posted to IHE on whether schools/ colleges should open in Fall 2020 in person. Final paragraph tells all.  Post: I'm wondering whether, if we put on a different lens, we'd see another option here. This is to suggest, assuming testing of high quality, that schools/ colleges reopen in Jan. 2021. And, there could be a soft launch in Fall 2020 for some students in small pods who want/need to be in school/college and for whom in person learning is key. The ""Covid-Pod"" approach would have different kinds of educational offerings -- everything from mini classes to pop ups. Here's the acid test: I was asked recently by a colleague: Were I still a college president, would I open in Fall 2020,  having engaged in a myriad of discussions? Honest answer: NO.  I would feel opening in a small town w/o sufficient medical facilities to handle 200 Covid cases quickly in a new peak and poor rural transport (no train or plane w/in an hour) and faculty/staff traveling from big distances presents too big a risk. I wouldn't want to increase the extant possibility of death. I need sleep at night; I would feel so responsible that every sneeze would send me into a frenzy of possible outcomes, many of which would make my current COVID nightmares pale.

 Avoid The Top 10 Mistakes Made By Beginning CRAFT,Craft,185178685,"Here's a law school hypo for all my former students and colleagues (+ lawyers/ law students out there): Suppose that you ingested Lysol and you injected it too. And, suppose you got the idea from the President. Suppose, too, that you had the supplies at home (diabetic mother-in-law) and before the warnings came down, you tried to ""clean"" your insides. When you burn your esophagus and then your veins collapse and you are rushed to the ER and catch COVID while waiting for a bed, do you have any causes of action and if so, on what basis and against whom? Please consider whether presidential immunity is considered waived when there is criminal or tortious behavior. Consider whether there is a cause of action against the company for producing a dangerous product that did not say on the label: this is NOT injectable. Is there a cause of action against the hospital for keeping you waiting and exposed to COVID? And, is there a cause of action against your mother-in-law for having needles that are freely accessible in your home despite the presence of non-diabetic adults and children? Keep your response short. Your answer can only be written in a blue book and must be legible. My hope: that you learned a lot this semester and that this exam allows you to show your analytic skills.

I believed and still believe its death was premature.  But there was no stomach among new  #  #leadership  and most trustees for innovative ideas, restructuring and change. Instead, to avoid lawsuits (they got them anyway) and Mt Ida like situations, they caved like a deck of cheap cards. Sorry to be harsh but the mirror reflection if people look isn’t complimentary. Now the VT State Colleges are facing closure on three campuses.  I have read the reports.  I think death is premature.  Yes to change. Yes to innovation. Yes to hard choices. Yes to reallocation of spending.  The chancellor is a financial dude — former State Treasurer as I recall from my time.  I get the finances.   If he were an educational innovator, I suspect he’d see some pathways forward. I have reached out.  No response (yet).  Folks, there are ways forward.  Many moons ago, I was a restructuring lawyer. The principles from Title 11 served me well and with help, SVC started truly thriving.  For real. Then I left and there were changes that made no sense, administrative bloat, low enrollment (they sought better students), low low fundraising and a gift that kept on taking. I want to help if people will listen.  Time is now.

 Why My GST Is Better Than Yours,GST,802920549,"I just wrote a piece on how to reopen schools and colleges post-pandemic.  I offer up 3 trauma-responsive changes. None cost money; they cost sweat equity, thought, creativity, reallocation of resources, new approaches, change.  Well, the first comment suggests: how expensive? How difficult?  How cost inefficient?   Now here's the point: folks can't see change as good. But, in this instance, the world has changed and going back to the status quo ante is a falsity. And anyone who does not recognize that placement tests and standardized tests post-pandemic and mandated upon reopening is really misunderstanding toxic stress, isolation, fear responses, ANS responses and the realities of a threat like COVID-19. Yes, these are all triggers for trauma.   Here's the link and here's my hope: those of you who are leaders need to help your workers and employees see the value of change, the need for change and the importance of change after a global traumatic event.

The press is now characterizing those who are having a psychological response to the threat of the virus as either OCD or struggling with anxiety disorders.  This is just plain wrong.  The threat itself is traumatizing -- for those with and without a history of trauma. Please read this piece on the impact of this on colleges and universities. It has broader applicability. We need to pay attention to the psychic impact of the threat of COVID-19. It is real; it is not a sign of mental illness; it is a response to trauma.   See:

 What Everyone Must Know About FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,417257825,"Here’s promised post w/ a few strategies (among many) to help educators help students deal w/ COVID-19 threats including diminishing the possible traumatizing effect, even in absence of attack on known individuals. A caveat: if schools close, that raises a host of issues not addressed here. 1.  Don’t pretend virus doesn’t exist by hiding reality. Being honest is key. How one expresses that honesty is a different issue. 2.  Do activities at start of class to lower autonomic nervous system; these should involve the senses. 3.  Consider pop-up courses for older students (short courses; small groups) and accurate activities on viruses for younger students.   Some pop up course suggestions: a) What is a pandemic (note word panic w/in it) and when have they occurred in US?; b) Are masks helpful in preventing disease spread; if so, for whom?; and c) Is quarantine the best strategy for disease containment? What does quarantine entail?  For younger students, consider these activities: a) Draw what viruses (any virus) looks like to you? Draw how it looks for real under microscope? Color images; b) What are vaccines and who creates them?  List current vaccines.  Note these topics don’t address COVID-19 virus head on; that’s purposeful. Knowledge is power as is stability and structure.

First, I saw the movie Wrestling Ghosts: powerful, moving, sad, hopeful.  It needed a serious debrief afterwards.  Lots of ideas that needed processing and Care Room helped but not enough.  Second: I think now that we misuse ACE score as a diagnostic tool when it is neither destiny or a personal measure of   #health .   What it is is actually a gateway into understanding others and oneself.  But the number free standing and without more and without context and without PCEs is somewhat misleading.  Its power is housed in what it tells us at 10,000 feet and on the ground if used well and understood for what it is and isn’t.  That later “isn’t” requires that lots of folks￼￼ reconsider their use and understanding of ACEs.

 How To Improve At ART In 60 Minutes,art,126856153,"Well, another quandary with respect to which I need some insight.  I just read the stories about the predator/ cult leader Larry Ray and his involvement with students at Sarah Lawrence College (including his own daughter).  It took a while but he was just arrested (later than necessary). The NYMagazine piece is chilling. My questions do not relate to the power of a cult figure on young people.  We have many examples of this... sadly. Here’s what I don’t get:  where were the Sarah Lawrence administrators and staff? Apparently, at least one knew something was “up” in a specific dorm and did not address the issues.  Perhaps a parent can spend a night or two or three in a dorm but Larry Ray’s stay appears to be much longer.  Didn’t folks notice?  Wasn’t there an RA?  I frankly am hard pressed to believe the College could claim to be so hands off or ignorant or accepting of parents living on campus. Weren’t red lights flashing? Lives and relationships were ruined.  What responsibility did/does Sarah Lawrence have and are the personnel then there  still employed?  Years in question seem to be 2010 — 2014.   There must be another piece or two of three that I am missing.  I have known some administrators there — remarkable people. Explain to me what happened please.

People think the attention to Kobe is undeserved.  Here are some reasons so many are touched: 1) We may not have known Kobe but he has been in our home for decades  (on television); 2) He started playing as a teenager and we marveled at but questioned his lack of a collegiate education -- so we wanted to ""see"" if he made it; 3) He was a rare talent who worked harder than anyone else, despite his abilities -- first to the gym, more reps than most; 4) He had commitment and passion for his sport and winning was his goal and he kept his eyes on the prize; 5) He was NOT a saint in many ways and had enough problems to sink most athletes (physically and with assault charges and marital woes) but he persevered; he apologized; he reconstituted his life; he built back his reputation from the sewer; 6) He cared about kids, his own and others; 7) He was a once in a generation talent, rarely seen and rarely encountered; and 8) He was a model for kids -- sort of like Be Like Mike (whose personal life was hardly in order and gambling etc.).

 Top 25 Quotes On PAINTING,painting,128316069,"Trauma has tentacles that wrap themselves around survivors.  That statement expresses this reality: school shootings have lasting effects on the survivors: students, teachers, families, communities. For proof, we need first to recognize the traumatic symptomology that survivors show. Consider this article and the LA Middle School teacher's continuing struggle with a school shooting in which she was injured.   https://lnkd.in/eAbHYVY This article and the teacher's symptomology are also why anniversaries (commemorations) of a trauma need to be planned thoughtfully, recognizing that the impact of trauma remains long after the actual incident. With the upcoming Parkland shooting anniversary on Feb. 14, we should all pause to reflect on what would produce healing that day as opposed to reactivation of our autonomic nervous systems.  And, this applies whether one was there, related to someone there, knows someone there, was involved in another school shooting, or is an educator who worries about shootings.  And, for the record, this isn't even a complete list of all affected parties.

 Boost Your POLITICAL With These Tips,political,832158168,"There was a recent article in the NYTimes about the work done (or not done) by an ER doctor and the ER in general.  The author cites a study undertaken at Yale’s ER that enabled the doctors and staff to do home visits to prevent repeat ER visits.  The point was this expanded role actually saved time and money and enabled improved patient care.  Motto was no longer “up (into hospital bed) or out (leaving ER).  There was connection and intervention.  And it improved revisits by 50%.     In my new book, Trauma Does Not Stop at the School Door, I make a similar argument about educators.  We need to expand our role; we can’t be content to be deliverers of content in a classroom.  I get that this will bother some, especially university professors.  But ask:  Isn’t the goal of educators to enable student success?  Isn’t the role of ER personnel to enable patient health?  Times have changed.  #educationreform  means that the scope of roles and thinking about our roles narrowly may not serve those we serve.  Ponder that as we approach 2020. Book will be released by TC Press in June 2020.

 How To Make Your DANCE Look Amazing In 5 Days,dance,207715600,"I just was listening to the news and there was another assault by someone working in a school on a student.  What school worker bodyslams a child?  I write about trauma. I usually focus on trauma that impacts students that occurs OUTSIDE the school or by an intruder/shooter into a school. I have not focused -- until now -- on trauma within the school caused by school personnel. Yes, I have observed teachers/professors causing non-physical trauma through poor pedagogy and demeaning words/acts, and I am well aware, sadly, of sexual assaults by school/university personal on a student. But, now I think I need to focus more attention, sadly, on physical trauma within schools.  It is not between students; it is not bullying student-to-student; those are bad enough. It is teachers/aides/guards assaulting students and causing harm —physical and psychological.  All I can say is that creating trauma responsive schools is critical and stopping trauma on students by adults in schools must stop.  No question about that. We need schools to be places that foster truth and trust.  We need both.  When assaults on students occur by professionals within schools, trust is destroyed.  Truth is, one hopes, still thriving if victims come forward and are believed.

 Learn To (Do) PROGRAMMING Like A Professional,programming,913325572,"It is raining hard in DC. Cleaning the city perhaps?  On all levels.  Anyhow, what a day to read and snuggle.  I was reminded yet again about the power of reading and the emotions it can evoke -- whether in adults or children. Reading can literally touch your heart -- so can words.  I just finished Delia Owens moving story, Where the Crawdads Sing.  Kya, the protagonist, learns to read late in her childhood and remarks after reading a poem something to this effect, ""Who knew words could carry such power?"".    I raise this for two reasons today.  Words have power, both positive and negative.  We relish the positive words and the enormous power evoked in us through them. But, we also have negative and discriminatory words and hurtful words (oft-times said in times of anger or in bullying or in a show of power).   These words have power too.   I'd suggest we look more carefully at all our words, starting with our leaders and political candidates and politicians.   We need to be careful. Words aren't just letters strung together.  Repeat: words are not just letters strung together.  They can hurt like weapons, causing psychic injury, and they can make one's heart leap with joy.  Seems the latter is way preferable by any measure.

Pot calling the kettle.... And poor role modeling.  Golfer Patrick Reed not admitting his own rule breaking.  Poor role modeling.  And don’t get me started on the Astros.   Instead of Melania Trump’s “Be best” — which isn’t proper English — what about “Be decent and be honest?”.  That’s a motto worth fighting for and adopting in words and deeds.  Would that people in power and the public eye stepped up to speak and act decently and truthfully.    And I recently have focused on why it is so hard to speak up and out.  Why is it so hard to ask people to be better?  Complex to do, especially when swimming upstream against a culture that seems to tolerate bad acts. But, enough already.   I just spoke up in no uncertain terms to a person I dated in my youth (initials BC) who back then crossed clearly set sexual boundaries I believed in and denigrated me for them.  It took me 45 years. But there’s a lesson there that applies to the above observations: better late than never.

Finally, it deals with object constancy, something of critical importance to children who struggle with trauma.  It is a book for the holidays and thereafter.  Enjoy and learn and play.

 5 Simple Steps To An Effective FASHION DESIGN Strategy,Fashion Design,124051393,"So, I have been reading and talking to folks about the impending merger (closure) of Marlboro College with Emerson.  Read recent article in Boston Globe.  All this brought me to realize a strategy that would have worked for Southern Vermont College and some other colleges in distress.  The idea:  right size them.   Could write more but for now: With impending and evident enrollment declines, shrink the spending side to match enrollment until new enrollment approaches are in place.  Yes.  Downsize in the near term.   That would cost some jobs within faculty and staff.  At SVC, I would have torn down old dorms which would cut costs and staffing.  I would have doubled up in new dorm on two floors and rented space for overflow.  I would have had a lean mean administrative team.  (Another leader bloated it for several years with outsized salaries.) Right sizing is hard but smart.  Look at Sterling College.  If past growth isn’t sustainable, adjust and fast.  Don’t bleed to death or ask trustees for repeated end of year shortfall bailouts. Goodness knows, Higher Ed needs to get smarter. Right sizing is smart and doable.  Otherwise, hearts will be broken with unnecessary closures.

DRAWING - So Simple Even Your Kids Can Do It,drawing,602127550,"So, with the holiday's approaching, I have been paying attention to how merchants sell their goods. I notice the sales they offer and the ads they produce, including some that prove controversial.   My children's books are, of course, ""goods"" but I think of them as delivering education. Add to that: I see them as a service not merchandise.  They are meant to be read to and with children. They combine learning with good, fun, warm and engaging stories. They are meant to be read and re-read. I was delighted that the most recent book in the Lady Lucy series, Lady Lucy's Ghost Quest, was featured in a holiday guide of books that kids will enjoy.

 How I Improved My MATHEMATICS In One Day,Mathematics,682149138,"Just an oddity on this post-Thanksgiving Friday.  There are sales galore.  Now focus on this: The US government was recently “selling” a fake US university in Detroit to foreign students.  And it “looked” real enough that students enrolled and paid thousands.   Who knows where the money went.  Now, the fake government was a success in trapping some of the student visa fraud.   This fake university success occurs as real universities/colleges are failing — and they are desperately trying to get students, domestic or foreign.   Is anyone seeing irony here?  The fake university enrolls students with ease while the real school admissions officers are struggling?   Two thoughts:  maybe government is onto a legal way to get new students and isn’t what US did entrapment?    One more thought:  is setting up a fake university the best use of government talent and resources?  If these gov. folks are so talented, why not have them work on real education at real educational institutions in need?   What a waste of talent and dollars on so many levels.  #  #colleges   #educationreform

 How I Improved My DANCE In One Day,dance,588891499,"What a world we live in? For traumatized students, this is about the worse that can happen, except physical punishment.  Traumatized children often feel isolated and have struggles to attach. And this is how we treat them? And if a student were not traumatized, this would make them a trauma survivor.  What has happened that we enable educators to behave in these ways?  What is needed is a radical change in how we think about and execute on punishment and discipline. We often blame the child (or student) for what happened to them NOT what they did.  Time for a change --- decades ago actually.  Watch for my new book from TCPress June 2020 titled Educating for Trauma.  In the meanwhile, yipes.

 27 Ways To Improve DRAWING,drawing,587816043,"On this Veteran’s Day, I have to wonder why we are not doing all that is possible to save Veterans from committing suicide.  Programs and initiatives  exist; technology exists.  But, we don’t act with all deliberate haste.  And each day we wait, over 20 Veterans die.  There are approaches, including a very recent study on suicide prevention tied into doctors who see Veterans within the year before death.   I am finishing Shulkin’s new book and am deeply struck by how much his vision of his tenure differs from reality.  As with many leaders who fail, he has not been able to own his mistakes, at least as of page 215 in the book.  Isn’t that tragic too?  He tells a tale in the name of Veterans but so far it is a book justifying his own behaviors.  Sure, politics is a tough game but the story Shulkin tells seems remarkably self serving.   I worry about our saying we are helping when we are really real aggrandizing or self enriching or self promoting.  Leaders committed to being in service to others focus on these others.   On this Veterans Day, it is good to remember what it means to serve — and we can serve in many ways.... and we can honor service and we can help Veterans when they leave service.  That isn’t asking too much.  It is the minimum we can provide.

 Master (Your) PAINTING in 5 Minutes A Day ,painting,942165436,"I just read a piece in Medium written by an adult whose childhood dentist hit her in the face. Sadly, lots of children are traumatized by the adults with whom they engage — not just parents.  Doctors, dentists, religious figures, coaches and even neighbors or contractors are implicated.  What happens is that children are silenced by the trauma and can’t speak up and out. The freeze response to trauma freezes our voice.  We then have children who hold their trauma within.  That is why I wrote a forthcoming book published by Columbia Teachers College Press (June 2020) titled Educating for Trauma: Strategies for Student Success.  Kids bring their trauma to school in suitcases of different sizes.  We need to help them now.  Waiting does not make trauma disappear. No indeed.  It just gets sublimated and cabined away.  Its symptomology remains.  The book will, I hope, help.

 10 Tips That Will Make You Influential In PAINTING,painting,380030252,"The Mount played a pretty remarkable game last night against Georgetown. And, for the first 3/4 of the game, they had it under control and then the gas just left the tank.  Free throws were not made, tightness set in and shots made earlier did not fall and Georgetown buckled down and hit their shots. Here's what this shows me:  The Mount has a stunningly good coach; their Mount players will be doing 100's of free throw drills today; the Mount players will augment training for endurance play; and they will practice 1 minute drills again and again.  As to GT, they can come back like this on a team that is unranked.  But it is not an ideal strategy for sure for the long season ahead. And seeing Patrick Ewing coach: amazing actually: he was always calm on the court (my favorite Knick) and as I recall he couldn't make free throws too well.  I liked his style of coaching.  He was more animated than I ever saw as a player. He needs some new and better players. I'll bet he'll be able to recruit.  All in all, good lessons here: the little guys are not so little; the big guys can't wait for the spigot to just turn on. College basketball is all about improvement.  What a night.

I’m reading my newest book in Lady Lucy series: Lady Lucy’s Ghost Quest.  Apt to release it on Halloween!!! But, there are real ghosts that haunt me over SVC’s closure, the location of the Lady Lucy Ghost Quest because there really are ghosts in the Everett Mansion. I think that lies/ bad acts circle round to haunt those who generated them — like ghosts. Even faraway travel isn’t an eraser.  I had to threaten one former leader with a lawsuit for lying!  There was blindness of those in power to the realities of the college’s true state and inability to develop timely creative solutions — not just throwing $$. I get that college’s fail.  Some shouldn’t ... SVC needed quality folks in power who reached out for quality help early.  They had to share the situation and issues with guarantors, lenders and prior leaders; could have saved SVC.   So, as I look at the book I wrote, stunningly illustrated by Dianne Sunda, I smile at the children’s tale but have more than a twinge of sadness/anger. The book serves as SVC’s obituary. Truth and ghosts do prevail in due time. Yes, there are profound messages here for other businesses in trouble.  Tell the  truth!

 How To Start PAINTING With Less Than $100,painting,705881655,"Help me understand folks.  I get the attraction to power and influence.  But, according to NYTimes (ok, question the source), Bill Gates had a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein that seemingly involved no sexual favors, just possible monetary and charitable deals.  Gates stayed late at Epstein’s home, once overnight.  He commented on odd lifestyle (attributed to odd furnishings).   Now, let me get this straight:  Gates never ever either saw or engaged in any sexual escapades involving young girls and only saw Swedish beauty and her 15 year old daughter (one-off event)?   Answer this: Was Epstein so good at compartmentalizing that there NEVER were young girls present when Gates was there?  And Gates wanted to be around power and influence of Epstein and his friends?   Couldn’t Bill Gates meet whomever he wanted on our planet earth? I’m sorry but something is off with this story. I get that power attracts power but there’s something way out of order here.

 5 Incredibly Useful HR MANAGEMENT Tips For Small Businesses,HR management,142502366,"So, in addition to Cerner and its $16 billion no-bid contract with the VA,  I have been reflecting on cultural change in education.  I am concerned that we move so slowly in education that many children who could benefit from improvements are left behind.   Today, I was listening to folks chatting about 5G and its implementation hurdles.  One speaker observed that we needed to be heartened by some changes — the move away from pay phones and phone booths to cell phones.  Those phone booths are anachronistic.  One generation and they are gone.  No coin calls basically.   I wonder whether the speed of technology and its acceptance can be transportable into education.  Why not get the next generation accustomed to trauma responsive institutions with problem solving and interdisciplinary efforts?  We think of Hampshire’s reforms as innovative.  Really? Many have pondered problem focused and thematic learning for decades but fear and tradition stand in our way when implementation is at issue. Why not deploy different models for education at all levels?  Take away the educational equivalent of pay phones and booths.  What do we have to lose? We have lots to gain.

 Proof That BANKING Really Works,banking,290471654,"I have been doing a lot of thinking lately about how the government spends money -- how it allocates its dollars (our dollars).  I have been struck by the no-bid Cerner contract with the VA to move to electronic health records which is estimated to cost $16 billion.  No typo.  See:  https://lnkd.in/e-bR3RW .   So, here's my question: What can you get for $16 billion if we had other spending priorities?  What disease could we cure for that amount?  Could we have universal early childhood education for that amount?  We have legislation with mandates that are unfunded; suppose we looked at some of those to fund?  A recent NY Times piece noted the proliferation of child pornography on the web and the absence of sufficient resources allocated to stomping out this problem. The legislation exists; the dollars don't. Bottom line: How can a private company get a $16 billion no bid contract when we have so many other needs?   Ask yourself: What can $16 billion buy?

CRAFT Your Way To Success,Craft,141017035,"Happy Labor Day, recognizing that for many, this is not a holiday but a work day.   I just read an article on donations to colleges and universities and how they failed to vet the source of donations — namely from Jeffrey Epstein. The Higher Education Times (a UK publication) said anonymity was an approach although not fully protective.   3 thoughts: 1.  How carefully ARE donations actually vetted in real life on campuses?  Sure, smaller colleges can vet more, and big donations stand out everywhere as worthy of vetting.   But how much money comes in from sources that, if we looked, would be deemed institutionally unacceptable?   2.  Cozying up to donors is a big part of fundraising.  So didn’t these institutions meet and stay in touch w/ Epstein?  Harvard said it isn’t returning the $$ it got. Is that because it was received before convictions? Didn’t Harvard send updates/reports to him?  Couldn’t Harvard show some grace and donate an identical amount to fund for his victims?  Ok: just return it. 3.  Wouldn’t it be easy to fool a college/university as to a donation’s source? Just create layers. Now ask: Is Sackler money being returned or just new $$ not bring taken by educational institutions? I’d say we need to do more thinking about donor source. Honorary Degrees too.

 Revolutionize Your BUSINESS With These Easy-peasy Tips,business,217830365,"I just read the Chronicle of Higher Ed’s daily summary. It ended with an apparently real story of a new college student who emailed her roommates saying that because since her name was in the first half of the alphabet, she got to move in 1st and pick the best bed.  Perhaps that was a joke by the roommate or the Chronicle.   But here’s what struck me: some new students feel fortunate just to have a bed as opposed to the best bed.  And can we all agree that there is not ONE best bed?  Might that depend on whether you like windows or corners or top/bottom bunk?  No conversation? What about switching beds every 3 months? There's a lesson whether the story was true or fake:  the entering classes at all universities are not composed of clones—clones of the parents or new students.  Might that engender an openness and capacity to engage thoughtfully w/ others as opposed to “owning the room” as the mother in the story is quoted as saying? How about owning decency? It saddens me that for some students the rocky start that many experience is exacerbated by privilege and false winning.  Maybe the tallest student picks first.  Maybe the one w/ the lowest GPA?  Maybe the artist or athlete?  Just saying: is the alphabet the stand in for privilege?   Might that depend on which alphabet too?

 The Quickest & Easiest Way To GST,GST,513637754,"I just read an article in InsideHigherEd about the 15 new incoming students at Hampshire College. IHE referenced a Boston Globe article describing the feelings of these students and those who chose to attend elsewhere.   Because Hampshire is struggling, they limited 1st yr enrollment.  And of those accepted, only 15 students deposited.  Reflecting on small entry classes, why is  it necessarily a bad idea to be one of those students and for some, it cld be beneficial. Start w/ this: the students know the institution is struggling. They chose to go to an institution that is free spirited and now working to solve fiscal issues.   Might that be like an adventure for some? A bonding experience?  Being a part of something bigger?  Pursuing new pathway in higher ed?  Isn’t that the Hampshire way?  Anti-complacency?

I raise this because I’m still struggling to save a small college that wld clearly need a soft reboot. I don’t think all students wld avoid that. Some might like the effort, energy, commitment. Just saying: small entry classes aren’t all bad. These 15 students are bold and brave.  Bravo/brava. Rainbows.

I had been sleeping but out I went.  I had my key and cell phone. Should have taken my wallet with 50/50 hindsight.  Sadly, I have had to evacuate buildings in other situations.  Here, there were no hotel personnel directing people.  Some of us on the side were close to building. Had there been a fire or bomb, we surely would have perished.   And then we lead ourselves (no personnel) away from building to street.  No hotel personnel.  Not one person.  When we got to front, a manger was there saying: false alarm.  Seriously, when I said there were no personnel on side, he lied.  He said there was someone— a doorman.  There wasn’t.  No Sheraton’s for me ever again.  Not trained in emergency management.  I am a trauma expert and there was ZERO preparedness.  Yipes.  Bad bad bad. Ironic because there was a note under our doors saying there would be drills Wednesday — Friday.

 How You Can (Do) MUSIC In 24 Hours Or Less For Free,Music,702930282,"Part 4 of 3: Okinawa to Vancouver to LA Now in Vancouver, headed to LA.  Reflecting on catching back the day I “lost”.  Many thoughts; there never was an intended Part 4.  But I have some remaining thoughts (perhaps jet lag induced): 1.  I get the many benefits of travel. But, both the mind and body need to be in the same place for a while to re-center.  That’s why I planned an extra day in LA.  I can tell it’s needed before I give a workshop.  If I did it tomorrow, it would be a fiasco. Hot tea and a shower; simple needs. 2.  There’s been lots for sale in every airport — duty free and not.  Guess having a captive audience encourages sales. So does the desire to hold something or have something to trip off memories.  And even if duty free is not cheaper, it sounds cheaper.  3.  We falter with transitions — from job to job, school to school, nation to nation.  We’d do well to focus on how to make folks feel welcomed to a new nation and welcomed home after a long trip.  Signage matters.  Friendly faces.   4.  Customs dude in Canada  asked where I was coming from.  Since when?  Last flight?  Place of origin.  Over the last week?  And then the question: was travel for business or pleasure? Why either/or? Can’t it be both? I’m a touch cranky.  Perhaps that part of travel too....

 How To Deal With(A) Very Bad DANCE,dance,858417227,"Recently, at a child care center in Okinawa, the art therapy teacher asked, “What makes you qualified as a trauma expert?” Not the 1st time I’ve been asked that question. The question is really a surrogate for: “Why should we trust you?” Stated another way, “Are you authentic?” Very legitimate. I often answer 1st (sometimes only) w/ my academic bona fides: I’ve been an educator for 4 decades. I’ve studied, written and spoken about student success and how trauma impedes positive  outcomes. I’ve developed trauma responsive programs. I’ve guided schools thru and after crises. I’m a certified psychological first aid provider.I’m in a trauma program at Rutgers Grad School of Social Work. I have a new book emerging titled: Gen Tt Goes to School. What I sometimes share and I suspect is better preparation: I was part of an effort to reopen a school post 9/11. I was president of a college w/ more than 1 traumatic moment, including suicide of the CFO.   But there’s more. I’ve personally experienced trauma. I have an ACE score of 7. My mother abused me; I witnessed her abusing 1 of my brothers. My husband developed Alzheimer’s and was physically and psychologically threatening. Bottom line: personal experience, well processed, trumps academic learning any day. Can’t beat real life.

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At GST,GST,759459802,"Part 3 of 3: Okinawa I’m not the best traveler. I do pack light (never check) and try to get from Point A to Point B in the quickest way (the price is worth it). I use airport lounges. Here are 4 things I’ve learned from my recent trip from DC to Okinawa and back.  I write this as I sit on one of several flights home. (1) I roll my clothes.  Yup.  Roll them and they take up less space and they rarely wrinkle.  (Our dog, a basset, is more wrinkled.) (2) I’m trying a melatonin regime for the 1st time —taking it at night starting before I leave and then switching to a.m. with a gap day and continuing when home.  So far so good. Will provide an update.   (3) It’s good to try new things — judiciously.  Japanese toilets are really remarkable but I wasn’t game to try them in a public place (the gizmos that is). Kept wondering about the quality of the water.  My point: Try new things smartly.  Don’t try some new food if you’re going on a boat excursion. Eat local. Why have McDs? Local food is fresher.  (4) Look at television a bit for several reasons: sports and language. In Japan, lots of baseball and ping pong. My point:  it has a cultural value.  And listen to the language of the nation where you are. News Japanese is well worth it. OK — there might be a Part 4.

 The Secret of GRAPHIC,graphic,973068699,"Part 2: Okinawa I spent a number of hrs at Kadina Air Force base and off base w/ military personnel stationed in Okinawa.  Many thoughts but here are 3: (1) Service members do a remarkable job protecting our freedom but it isn’t easy on them or their families. They are moving frequently, adjusting to new homes, cultures and jobs. That’s why tradition-from music to ceremoniesis so impt. It creates continuity in world of discontinuity. (2) I spent time w/ military children on and off base. As someone w/ expertise in trauma, I saw too many kids w/ autonomic nervous systems on alert.  I cld identify, among some 30 kids, 4 or 5 who weren’t in a gd spot, evidenced by factors including: trouble concentrating, diminished memory, flocking (hanging off stranger’s leg), not sensing personal space, trouble w/ abstractions. We wld be wise to have trauma sensitive child care centers across the globe w/ common traditions creating continuity. 3. Our military are well trained, and training and preparation are perpetual.  Not just physical training either. Outside the military, continuing education isn’t ubiquitous.  We’d do well to require those, even at the top, to continue learning, challenging themselves w/ new advances and constant exposure to younger people.  Businesses wld benefit.

 Can You Really Find SCIENCE (on the Web)?,science,512937025,"As I leave Japan, having spent 5 days in Okinawa, I am struck by so many things.  Here are a few worth, I hope, sharing.   1.  In Okinawa, Americans are not welcomed still in many ways.  And except when on a US military base, there is a sense of American imperialism, where we have overtaken an island not our own.  As Americans we are used to being seen as  “top dog”, so it is important I think to recognize that other peoples are not always fond of us — for good and bad reasons. 2. I have traveled near and far but few places feel as foreign and with so little English as Okinawa.  Were I stationed there, I would learn their language — not only to navigate but to show respect.  Not just hello and goodbye.   3.  The local Okinawa crafts, found in hidden places on the island, represent amazing artisans, many of whom are not frequented by Americans.  Americans tend to go to “touristy” places, theme parks with fake crafts.  It is different to see weavers weaving and smell the wet clay and see the glass blowers blowing.  And buying that art, whether or not objectively valuable, has enormous value in terms of personal cultural artifacts and connection to people and place.   Watch for installment two!

10 Best Practices For GRAPHIC,graphic,10977171,"I’m sitting at Dulles Airport on my way to Okinawa, not exactly proximate. So awaiting 1st leg at Gate Z10 (who even knew Z gates existed?), I read 3 separate articles in NYTimes that are intertwined and message on leadership.  Start with this from an interview of Prof. Anita Hill. She states: “Leadership at the top, on any issue, in any institution, is what changes the game.”   Then turn to piece on p. B7 about mistakes.The author observed that we stick to things that don’t work (ed leaders of failing colleges, wake up!) because of “commitment bias.”We cling to prior behavior because our egos don’t like to be embarrassed.   Then turn to piece on Boeing on p. B6 where Boeing CEO said company made a “mistake” relative to handling of the absent warning light in some Max jets. It kept problem secret. Now combine these pieces. Boeing made a set of errors. Surely that showed commitment bias. Change requires a new leader. Bottom line: Boeing’s leader isn’t for change.  Colleges w/ leaders who replicate past approaches are doomed. Boards need to get a change leader if they want change, someone who’ll overcome commitment bias. It took 3 articles to make 1 key point: fire leaders who aren’t change agents when you need change.Otherwise you will have a paper house, like one pictured.

 How To Sell POLITICS,politics,705209194,"I used to be a Steve Kerr fan.  No longer.  Read this piece on Nowitski decision, and Nelson (coach) owned that decision not to play him. Kerr not only deferred all decisions to GM but did not make the hard choice: prohibiting KD from playing.  True leaders own their choices good or bad.  That’s not easy.  If you are a leader and your institution fails  and falls into sewer and you have been leader for more than a couple years, you own it ... denial is both unleader-like and disingenuous.  Kerr fell in my book; courage and making hard decisions are the hallmarks of real leaders.  Sadly, we are seeing too many examples of leadership failure.  Bad role models too — in athletics and education.  What happened to following the adage that leaders take the blame?  Maybe these leaders are working so hard to keep their jobs that they don’t do their jobs.  Bad news on all fronts.  Wear a sign as a coach or college president or any other leader: the buck stops with me.  That’s in case one forgets!!!

 Got Stuck? Try These Tips To Streamline Your MUSIC,Music,320614484,"Talk about speaking truth to power: brava. Most people are not in a position to share so publicly. Recently, I have been using the bully pulpit to share wrongs -- and when I reflected on this and discussed using social media in this way -- I was told: you have the platform; use it.  There is a key point there: not everyone can speak up and out and deal with the aftermath too.  If you can speak up and out, even with some backlash and risk, it will help others.  Anita Hill taught us well: speak truth to power, even when power does not listen.  So, those can, please speak.  Our world will be better for it.  And for those stung by truth (like the physician who acted like G-d or the airlines (American) that could not apologize in a heartfelt way or the authority who issued a ticket when one of the issuing officers was uncredentialled (Florida) or the dog breeder that lied and sued and lost claiming breach (Iowa) or the lawyers who send letters seeking settlement dollars when the cases lack merit (national): apologize.

 5 Reasons SCIENCE Is A Waste Of Time,science,577689041,"The news is filled w/ people acting badly, and at least for me, in some unexpected tangled ways.

Steve Kerr of Warrior fame saying what he said post game: suggesting that the achilles injury was not even mentioned as a possibility for KD. Seriously? How's that possible? We have David Ortiz being shot at point blank range in an apparent hit for hire. We have children being shot and killed by parents in custody battles. We have wives disappearing. We have airplanes that are downright dangerous and now still grounded. And then I have experienced several more personal incidents:  a cardiologist who considers himself the equivalent of G-d; an airplane landing that was unnecessarily rough w/ no heartfelt apology at time or after (American Airlines);an individual questioning a transaction while missing key details like the donor flying up on a personal jet to work with senior team; a former institutional leader making libelous accusations for which he was threatened with a lawsuit if he did not cease and desist.

 Fascinating PROGRAMMING Tactics That Can Help Your Business Grow,programming,346428333,"Mini pop-up kid’s bookstores:  here’s an idea! As you may know, I write children’s books.  For me, it’s a concrete way of trying to close the equity divide.  Reading, vocabulary, a love of words, creativity and imagination are key to educational success.   I’ve puzzled over how to get books into the hands of kids that need them most. I do readings in all sorts of venues but that doesn’t give kids books to take (except in exceptional situations where organizations/schools have placed large orders). I’ve been reflecting on offering books in unusual, unexpected  settings like doctors’ offices.  Physicians could give them to patients free or subsidize their purchase. Pediatricians, OBs. I also think bodegas are options—at counters like candy, gum or magazines in supermarkets.   See photo below of the “mini pop-up kid bookstore” I created for a small market in DC.  If it works there, I’ll expand to other bodegas.  I supply the stand/books (books are reasonably priced to vendor) and they can sell them at wholesale, retail  or give them away. Perhaps the effort could be underwritten by some  organizations, communities, merchants or churches.   Look at the image, share ideas and reactions and if you want a “mini pop-up bookstore” in your office, let me know.  I can make that happen!

 The Untapped Gold Mine Of MUSIC That Virtually No One Knows About,Music,298887496,"I think we get scared to speak up and out when we are wronged.  It is especially hard for those who are young or not in power.  Think about women harassed or students punished.  I recently had someone tell blatant lies about me in writing in an email chain.  At first I thought silence was the answer.  Folks who matter know the truth.  There are risks to speaking up. But, I think lying and false accusations must stop.  So, I wrote the offender and defined libel and demanded an apology and I copied others who were included.  I even copied someone, asking that the offender be “tamed.”  Sad that I had to do that in the first place.  But, I think we need to stop those who blame others wrongly, who tell falsehoods and don’t own their own actions and accompanying outcomes.   At the end of the day, I still believe that those who do wrong to others will get their comeuppance.  In the meanwhile, I am guided by my conscience, integrity and the fact that I can and should role model.  Complaining isn’t the answer.  Speak up ... silence is not golden when one is libeled or slandered.

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,717185479,"Today, there is a powerful and disturbing story in NYTimes about UNC’s  pediatric cardiac surgery unit. It had a much higher death rate than other similar programs.   There was many lessons here in terms of why failure persisted and flaws were so slow to remediate. I want to focus on just 1 now. But there is much to be garnered from this investigative piece about other failures, including in education, airplane manufacturing and pharmacology.   The doctors at UNC at several points considered sending patients elsewhere and one physician is quoted as asking:  Would you send your own child here? Once the answer had been yes and then it turned to no. Lesson: if you wouldn’t send your own child here, don’t send anyone else’s.  The litmus year of quality is whether you or your family would use the services or product.  Consider that question at Boeing with its Max plane. Consider that question at some schools and colleges. The question begs institutions to turn into somewhere or something they’d encourage their family to use (assuming appropriateness as surely you’d only use a pediatric cardiac team if your child needed that).   Quality can be measured, then, by whether one would recommend the service/product for one’s own.  So Boeing, did you or your families fly on the Max?

The Cookery in Shirlington (Arlington) VA is having an event June 1 starting at noon in their remarkable cooking/food store for International Children's Day. And, they will be making a donation to Save the Children. I will be doing a book reading and signing at this event -- with two of my newest children's books. There will be food, fun and activities. One of the goals is to enable children to appreciate the fun that can come from engaged reading and the books are meant to achieve that.  Also, given the starvation and deaths of children across the globe, it is worth pausing and reflecting on what we can do to improve the lives of the next generation -- near and far. There is homelessness and food scarcity in many areas -- hidden and not so hidden poverty and a deep inequality for children in education too. That gets me to my next point: I will be at Molly Stark School in VT (which is I believe close to 100% free and reduced lunch) on June 3 to read and work with children.  I will be sharing one of the new books and helping kids appreciate the value of words and reading.

 10 Ways To Reinvent Your OPERATING SYSTEM,operating system,959916021,"Morehouse College Honorary Degree Recipient Robert F.

He said he was part of the Class of 2019 and they all needed to start the next phase on a level field.  Wow! How remarkable, especially given that there was apparently no knowledge ahead of time that Mr. (now Doctor) would make that promise. What a gift. What an act of grace. What a way of paying it forward. And Mr. Smith wasn’t  a Morehouse alum! Forget how high the bar is for honorary degree recipients moving forward.  Forget the feelings of relief so many there experienced. Don’t forget that Morehouse is an HBCU that has struggled financially.  Don’t forget the powerful message of belief in graduates and their promising future as leaders. If I had a magic wand or billions of dollars (I don’t), I would repay the debt of every 2019 graduate of a college that is closing this year. Talk about a remarkable end. I understand the “last” Southern Vermont College graduation this weekend was moving and forward looking. I’m glad the event was so memorable.

Many moons ago, an old friend Steve Leveen asked if I would do a podcast where he interviewed me for his site and project: America the Bilingual.  I did but promptly forgot about the initiative until he just completed a podcast called Buds of Bilingualism and there I am speaking Icelandic.  It brought back memories, reminding me of my own tradition where I give the introduction to my remarks in the language of the nation where I am speaking. I had recently been in the Yakama Nation and started my remarks at Heritage University in Yakama. So, you are interested in how to use foreign language to develop cultural competency, this podcast's for you. Link's below.  But, for me, the podcast also raises a deeply troubling question in American education. We seem to look down at our non- or beginning English speaking students. Because they do not speak our language, we assume them to be ""lesser.""  Yet, they speak more languages than most Americans -- they speak their native language plus at least some English.

 Rules Not To Follow About PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,256144772,"I want to share a concept in my new book on trauma that is  counter-intuitive.   When disasters strike like shootings at schools/colleges, we often go on lockdown and then release kids to families or older students to their dorms or homes.  We even shut down institutions. If the end of a school year is upon us, we wrap things up and folks depart. I think more attention needs to be paid to what I call “processing in place.”  Instead of separating people, we need to focus on and foster community.  Instead of going away, we need to go back and share with those who were there.   Ponder the experience of soldiers when they get stateside and lose their buddies.  Is that why vet suicides occur at VA hospital sites—the soldier is with others like them in some sense?   In the case  of UNC-Charlotte, the end of the semester is not trauma’s friend.  Perhaps the university will extend the semester, allowing students, faculty and staff to process in place — if they want that. How we process in place isn’t a simple idea and if space is tainted, that’s problematic.  More on those points later.  But you can’t process in place if you aren’t in place — physically or perhaps virtually.   Ponder the power of processing in place with me.

True. But the whole incident shines a spotlight in inequality in education and across America. And, ironically, the bribes ostensibly went to help low income kids. Yup, that's the tax fraud part. So have those pleading guilty do just that: donate to a cy pres fund that benefits low income kids and the non-elite small colleges that serve them. Redistribute the cy pres to colleges with more than 40% Pell eligible students and/or 50% first gen students and under 1200 students and endowments under $10 million. Then use the funds for scholarships and institution sustainability. The cy pres agreement would be part of a court ordered settlement and the distribution could be decided by a cy pres committee or designated court appointed official. Make lemonade out of lemons. Force these parents to do what they actually said: give to help low income students. Do good from bad.

 Here Is A Quick Cure For SCIENCE,science,332182846,"So, first, silence for a few days does not mean I am not pursuing approaches to try to save SVC (and other small colleges that serve students — nursing, Rad tech, cj, social services, business.) The articles today in Chronicle of Higher Ed are telling about the price students pay when their college closes.  Can we do better?  Can we help these institutions?  Surely we can try.  Without trying, we get nowhere.  So I’m trying on several fronts - legal and fundraising and gov.    On a somewhat related topic, watch for a new post on colleges issuing certificates of failure to show students it is ok to fail.  Not sure what psychologist or professor dreamt up this idea and I appreciate that learning involves risk taking.   But, certificates of failure?  To hang on a wall?  To acknowledge competition?  To make bad grades acceptable?  I see vastly different ways to help students other than  issuing failure certificates.    Piece to appear shortly.  At small non-elite colleges, can you imagine certificates of failure?  Wait til you see them — look like degrees except for failure.  Yipes.  Another Yipes.  I believe in real degrees and real support.  Not diplomas of failure.

 Old School SCIENCE,science,420134924,"I have often thought rich colleges could partner with less wealthy colleges — sort of academic adoption.  When endowment size was an issue that threatened their continuance, I thought this was an idea: invest in a neighboring small colleges and help them thrive and now survive.  No takers.  Williams wasn’t interested when I asked and their president then (not Morty Shapiro) showed overt disdain.  I actually chatted with famous Yale endowment advisor (Swensen) and he saw merit. That said, the rich get richer.  And small colleges that serve communities and students who are not going to elite colleges for any number of reasons, get poorer.  Sure, some small colleges are not being innovative and creative.  I still believe SVC can be saved and I continue to pursue different avenues regardless of naysayers.  Giving up isn’t in my vocabulary.  SVC didn’t train nurses and Rad techs to give up on patients.  We didn’t give up on students who struggled.  So, why give up on SVC?  Bravo to the author!

I say, which is partly accurate as of this moment in time, I am trying to save a small non elite college.  I explain that despite the current protestations and accusations, I left it after 8 years in good shape and fully capable survival.  In the 4 plus years since I left, it tanked.  And it fell precipitously in the last 2 years. Someone said, that’s impossible.  Colleges don’t crater and suddenly announce they’re shutting.  Something’s wrong. Something happened in the recent past. I said, well, maybe but more likely something didn’t happen: fundraising, grant raising, admissions, athletic recruiting, poor acquisitions.  But, I explained I hadn’t seen financials or data or what was filed with accreditors.  The group looked at me quizzically and I just looked at them and said, beats me.  My job now is to try to save it.  Anyone here have 3 million and want a college named for them? A few laughs and no immediate takers but one fellow said:  I bet there is someone like that.  I said:  I know.  I am looking for him or her right now. Funny how life is, isn’t it? What if one of those people was that one? Folks:  if you don’t try to save a place it will never be saved.

 5 Ways To Get Through To Your SCIENCE,science,767468141,"So, April the Giraffe is giving birth and thousands are fascinated as nature takes its course and nature’s beauty abounds.  People by the thousands are glued to the giraffe cam.  And there’s running comments on a feed.  April has the patience and calm of a saint; her partner Oliver is pacing.  In a world of bad news, this is of value and absent a medical disaster, a new giraffe will grace our presence soon. As this is happening, I am working to birth (save) a college — Southern Vermont College.   Unlike April, I am not patient and the birthing is filled with hurdles and mistruths that can’t be cured by the peppermint and pickles April is getting.   But, I’m not giving up. And I won’t  go down w/o a fight despite all the naysayers.  Don’t get me started on the misstatements. Makes my blood boil.   And folks are watching to see if this college can be birthed/saved.  They are watching closely as they should.  There’s no cam to capture the efforts but they exist for sure and for real. Here’s a thought. If April gives birth today, that’s a sign perhaps of another birth today.  Both the new giraffe and college will need nurturing and stability and care.  Both can get that. Here’s hoping today is a good birth day amidst the frenzied and frightening stories about college admissions.

 Revolutionize Your MUSIC With These Easy-peasy Tips,Music,427848867,"Something is drastically wrong with college accreditation, both in terms of who is getting and maintaining accreditation and who is losing it.  Bennett College was cited for lack of resources; it had an opportunity to raise $$ before the appeal.  The goal was $5 million but over $9 million was raised. The accreditor was unimpressed apparently and said: this was not enough. It’s like moving the standard higher when you hit the mark.  How does that work?  Now consider the for profit college accreditor which was removed by the prior administration  for failure to identify quality educational gaps in the institutions it oversaw and playing favorites.  Under the current administration, this decision is being reversed.  Does anyone see the irony, the inequity, the unfairness to small private non profits? Since when can we reverse decisions or move the goal posts with such ease?  I’m worried about small college accreditation.  You should too.  I am worried about for profit accreditation.  You should too.  Does the fact that Bennett is an HBCU cut against them?   Just asking if big corporate educators can crush small historic places that serve students not shareholders.

 Get Rid of FASHION DESIGN Once and For All,Fashion Design,27790142,"Here's a lesson for leadership in a time of crisis:  When things go wrong, a leader needs to own the wrongs that have occurred.  It's easy to cast blame on others who held power in the past. But anyone holding a leadership position for more than a year or two has to take responsibility for current messes/mistakes. And, new leaders, this is hard and I know from experience and my own errors: you can only blame your predecessor and institutional bad acts for so long.  Once one gets the lay of the land, a leader owns the institution's past. Ownership is key to trustworthiness, the ability to live with oneself and to take real action.  Blame gets you nowhere. Why do I raise this now? With all the institutions struggling with one crisis or another, particularly in education, we can see the value of being forthright.  Stand up and own what went/is wrong. And, then take the steps needed to remedy the situation. Think Georgetown owning its slave past. Remarkable. Think Penn State not owning its silence. Troubling.  And, by the by, PR folks would agree: It's best for institutions moving forward if their leaders step forward.  Remember the President of Columbia who climbed out his office window to avoid student protesters? As they say in the law, res ipsa.  #presidency   #leadership   #crises

 How To Win Friends And Influence People with ZOOLOGY,zoology,564521125,"I just want to say as the sun rises, what if Judge Kavanaugh had told a diff story about his GT Prep HS/ Yale days.  Suppose he indicated that, given his background, he was overtaken by the freedoms before him and drank and partied too much and in over-the-top ways. He was like an unstuck drawer. As he's matured, he has seen how his behavior was misguided (how much vomiting does one need to experience), and he hopes that his own children can grow up in a way that does not require that level of rebellion to find their way.   Now assuming no sexual assaults in this period (a huge leap of faith for me as I believe the victims), he would not have lied. He wouldn't have had former classmates crawling out of the walls; he wouldn't have had his yrbk words to defend; he wouldn't have done a FOX interview (when winning, silence is better; when offense is weak, put up a loud defense). He wouldn't be discussing his virginity (or anything close to intercourse), and he would have been honest. I repeat: he would have been honest. Painting oneself as a saint is a surefire method for people coming to destroy that image. Who's a saint after all? Once you lie, the lies keep growing. That's, sadly, the story of a lying nominee.

If the point of a hearing is to hear, then prejudging and announcing one's vote ahead of time or that Judge Kavanaugh will be appointed misses the point of a hearing. And why plow ahead?  We plow fields not people. I get the rush but do we do justice by rushing to find truth? One more thought:  Youthful indiscretion is not rare. What is bad here is: failure to own one's past; failure to apologize; lying. The Justices decide about real people; truth matters.  Truly matters.  So does integrity.  So does honesty.  Judge Kavanaugh is not being criminally charged (too late); but he bears burden of persuasion.  This isn't about innocent until proven guilty in a criminal trial. There is no trial.

 Stop Wasting Time And Start GRAPHIC,graphic,385459882,"A recent article in the Boston Globe described the struggles of small colleges and their likely collapse in the not too distant future. Sure, some will close but I have a different take. Here's a part of my response: As the former president for 8 plus yrs of one of the colleges referenced, I want to share a more optimistic take on small colleges, including the one I led with a remarkable team over the years.  I want to begin with three questions: (1) Whom do these colleges serve? (2) Are their graduates better for having attended and graduated (and even those who stopped out, are they better for the experience)? and (3) If not small colleges, where?    Ponder these questions/answers. Small colleges, non-elite small colleges, help many first generation, Pell eligible students find their way.  That's powerful in and of itself.  Small colleges have faculty who actually teach, and teaching and pedagogy matter to them.  Small colleges produce people who help make the world go round: police officers, nurses, community based workers, social workers, teachers, small entrepreneurs, radiology techs, healthcare advocates, coaches.  Returning to the article: You bet there is a place for small colleges.  I'd put money on it.  I believe.  My question is really: why don't you?

Wade.   I worry about all this and I looked at the book.  Many of the signs speak to these two identified issues.  Get the book. Remember what we value and what matters to us and why fighting peacefully has such enormous power.   The book contains this line, which remains sadly true:  ""Whatever pathways and hurdles we face, we are connected -- as exemplified by these signs --to move forward, to use our individual and collective talents to teach our child and our children's children well.""

10 Best Practices For DRAWING,drawing,223174142,"So, an article appeared in Inside Higher Ed on why leaders are failing to stop sexual harassers/abuse/rape on their campuses.  Here was/is my answer: I think there are many reasons. 1st, try campus culture, an issue that runs wide and deep. So do traditions that encourage bad behavior. Look at Prep Schools as exemplars. 2nd, the ""hands-off"" leaders have real trouble; it's good to delegate but....And, there needs to be a culture of transparency and an overt culture where bad news can and must be shared, not buried. 3rd, there are rose colored glasses as in: this too will pass. Nope. It won't. 4th, much of the training is poor, and people resent needing training suggesting they know all the issues. Reform the training. Bring in outsiders to do it and make it worth the faculty, staff, coaches and administrators' time. Poor training leads to poor outcomes. And resentment about waste of time. 5th, how we handle crises when they occur on campuses is weak and needs reformation. We make things worse, not better, because we aren't experts. Bring them in. 6th, to return to my favorite topic: Ask this. If there were co-presidents, could all this happen as it did on all these campuses? Speculating yes. But, pretty confidently, I can say that co-presidencies would curb this.

 5 Romantic BANKING Ideas,banking,75056936,"I just read this absolutely beautiful, honest and heart warming and heart wrenching piece written by the amazing Carrie Froese. It's titled the Magnitude of Motherhood.  Here's a link ( https://lnkd.in/d2SutnN ). Here's my response: What an absolutely beautiful piece. Heartwarming, heart wrenching and honest to its core.  I used to worry about my son dying -- for no particular reason. I just worried because life was and is filled with danger.  And, I could not imagine much worse fate than losing a child, except perhaps a child losing a parent when the child is young.  Now, my relationship with my adult son is strained for many reasons, some valid and others not.  But, as Mother's Day approaches I know this: there really is no love like a mother's for her child (or children).  And, one hopes that as a parent, one gives one's child both roots and wings as the saying goes.  And, one more thought on Mother's Day, for the children who don't have mothers or have mothers who don't care sufficiently or are psychologically absent:  don't despair. There may be no biological substitute but there are many of us more than willing to be ""parents"" or ""mentors"" or surrogate mothers if, as and when needed.  That's worth remembering too.

What differentiates you from others (one hopes this is a positive question)? What do you want to accomplish in 2018? What positive message do you have for others?   I plan to answer his questions again and again (he had a long list); they enable me (and others) to self-reflect.  Join me.

 How To Lose Money With DRAWING,drawing,491267034,"So, after the fortune cookie message (glad many of you read about it), I am now starting Day 5. So far, I've had many realizations, some obvious; others less so. Here's a wee sampling: 1.  Nations may speak the same language (in this case English) but there remain remarkable cultural differences notwithstanding. And some terms are different too: Q-tips are cotton buds is a fun example.  Take Sunday. It is really a day of rest. Many stores and restaurants were closed on and off campus. A day of reflection. I see that cultural sensitivity is needed every minute.  2.  I am apparently hyper-sensitive to being an American given our politics and President. Case in point. I misplaced my hair brush in the move (small but impt. item). I decided a beauty salon was a good place to go to buy a replacement and found one a short car ride from campus.  When they rang up the charges, the brush was over $27 US. Trust me, it was not a fancy brush. I suggested something was wrong with the price and while they were re-assessing the price for me agreeing that it seemed high, I added: ""I may be an American but I am not stupid."" Really, I said that. Yipes. More as the stay progresses.  I am already seeing that the academic literature read across nations differs vastly.

And, I see first hand how hard it is for new students, decades younger than I am, to transition to a new institution. Will write on that soon; it is an experience that reminded me of Racing Odysseus, one of the best books written by a former college President as he returned to college as a student -- ironically, the US St. Johns College.   Consider this a broader message for all of you trying something new, going to some new place and trying some new employment strategy.

 15 Tips For FASHION DESIGN Success,Fashion Design,112950312,"I just saw a quote by Annette Breaux that beautifully states what all teachers, professors and student life staff know or can benefit from knowing: ""Remember, everyone in the classroom has a story that leads to misbehavior or defiance. 9 times out of 10, the story behind the behavior won't make you angry.  It will break your heart.""   I'd change the word ""classroom"" to the word ""campus""  or ""school"" --- and that expands the quote meaningfully and importantly.  I was recently on a panel where I suggested that we offer support to new minority faculty.  Another panelist said: why is that needed?  They can do it on their own.  I said: not everyone can or should be forced to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.  What is wrong with helping others, even without their asking?  Let's be clear and candid: We all need help in one way or another. And, many of the rules of the game of the academy are not so clear and are not spelled out as another panelist pointed out so aptly.   And, if we can enable success, does it really matter as educators how we do it?  As long as success is there (real success), is there some reason we think those who don't ask for or get help are better?  Moral superiority for being able to work alone?  Please.

Wouldn't you want this paramedic in your ER?  We must do better enabling the transfer of skills from military service to civilian credentials.  And, ask: Would the VA hire this paramedic?

What kind of world is that? Oh, we blame mental illness.  Perhaps there has been mental diminution in those who have been the shooters.

Do we treat the later comments as a reflection of the real feelings of the person speaking and ignore earlier flawed rhetoric or do we look at the first words spoken and treat them as ""truth?""  Does it matter if it is minutes, hours or days between the first comments and the improved comments?

Were I to institute a look-see at Princeton, I would look at culture first -- what is it in the culture that enables men to seek and thrive in leadership posts.

And, this is, of course, the document that creates our freedom.   For the many years our now adult son lived at home, I read this document to him --- from start to finish -- on July 4th. (We read the I Have A Dream speech too on Martin Luther King Day).  I hope and think it helped him become the person that he is -- filled with a desire to help those in need and preserve what is valuable in and to our nation.   Create a new tradition then in your own family  -- whether you are a new parent or a parent of older children: Read one of our nation's founding documents and be proud of the message it sends.  And, if your children are grown, just re-read the document for your own sake. In these troubling times, it messages positively and powerfully.

 7 Rules About MATHEMATICS Meant To Be Broken,Mathematics,667251452,"Here is what is worrying me (among other things): recommendation letters. There is a history of such letters being written for teachers to get new positions despite the fact that these teachers have abused students.  We often are less than honest (if omission counts) when we write letters of recommendation.  We assume receivers of letters can read between the lines and know that we are not truly recommending someone but we are being cautious to avoid charges of defamation, libel and other legal risks.   So, posit this hypothetical: write a recommendation letter for Bill O'Reilly.  What should it say? Would all references to sexual abuse/harassment be absent from such a letter?

The candidates didn't shake hands at the last debate.  One threatens to jail another.  One abuses women according to accounts of many credible women. How do we educate for the good and how do we root out education filled with venom and hate and distrust of others?

A profound and extraordinary experience. I've got to share some photos of the fieldwork that students in Shanghai are carrying out. Perhaps educators here can use this assignment as a project because many of us are struggling to convert in-class work to the virtual. These are 1st year students. Their job was to do some fieldwork at a teahouse in the city. Blew me away.  Their commitment to the class makes me wonder how wonderful we would be in the US, if we gave more resources to schools across the board, more respect to teachers and more honor to students. Now we're facing unimaginable gaps. US folk, we are behind the curve ball, the corner pocket, the corn field and the corner sto'.

 Does PROGRAMMING Sometimes Make You Feel Stupid?,programming,393825942,"The blurred lines of private companies and censorship emerged when Facebook put out a list of banned notables that they labeled as ""extremists"".

It also gave people a sticker shock at the price of education and looming student debt crisis. Smith pledged to wipe out student loans estimating to be $40 million.

In this reality, you need more than just actively reaching out to candidates. In marketing, Lead-gen will get you that steady flow of leads every business needs.

How close was this friend to your candidate?   What do you do if the process is discret? There’s no wrong or right answer.  I treat recommendations like perfume - I enjoy their smell, but I’ll never drink them. The interview process is 5X more important than any recommendation, official or unofficial.

Answering and then ignoring, scheduling a job interview and not showing up, not returning any calls.  Ghosting usually saves you 1-2 minutes of inconvenience. But it brands you as a douche forever.  No one likes uncertainty. Whatever you are - a candidate, a recruiter or a sourcer - treat people like you want to be treated. Be responsible. Learn to say ‘sorry, but no’.

One of the best tips I have for job seekers is to use friends and professional networks but, how to do it effectively? 1. Lookup for all of your 1st connections on LinkedIn, then organize them by- people that know you personally and can validate your work[from school, past companies, etc]  2.  Reach out to every one of these connections with a summary about yourself, what you are looking for, and ask them kindly to apply on your behalf to their companies. 3.  When they agree [Yay!], ask them to add a few words about your work together and to send it directly to the hiring manager. This has a lot of weight on the CV screening decision.  4.  When hiring managers have valid information about you from a friend they trust it and increases your chances to get hired. 5.  After passing the CV screening use your friend as your source of information about the company! Ask them about the culture, challenges, and projects, and prepare yourself for the phone screening! Just applying isn't enough these days, the game has changed and you need to do the best. #hr   #jobhuting   #linkedin   #recruitment

It is a MUST. 👉🏼Ask to meet your team even if it’s not included in the hiring process. 👉🏼Ask someone you personally know that works there 👉🏼Google it 👉🏼Glassdoor it. 👉🏼Instagram it. Yes. Culture is most visible there.   Salary is just one factor, and not the most important one.  #Never  join a company blindfolded.   #hr   #interview   #career   #hiring

 How To Use ART To Desire,art,82112359,"Want to make a shift?  Switch to a new position? Venture into a new field?  DO THE WORK. Listen - talk to someone. A real person who’s been doing what you seek to do for a few years.  Understand what it takes to do their job - skills, experience, education, talent. This can validate (or nullify) your decision to pursue it in the first place. Learn - show interest.  Listen to podcasts, connect to professional groups, read articles. Get acquainted with the jargon. Know to speak the right language. It takes time.  DO - start your own project in that field. A blog. A podcast. Volunteer somewhere. Do something. This will give you plenty to talk about in interviews.  This is a MUST.  Write - post on LinkedIn or in professional groups/forums with your thoughts. Share your approach online. Comment to industry leaders. Engage.  Motivation is great.  It’s not enough in today’s market.  Do the work to gain an edge.   Job search IS a job.

DANCE Works Only Under These Conditions,dance,631202253,"Want a better chance at that job you want to get hired for? ‘Translate’ your CV to the language the company is using. Focus on 2 elements in your CV: Title - make sure your title fits the job description. If the job description lists ‘software engineer’, don’t use ‘Backend engineer’ in your CV. If there’s a way to get a perfect match, use it. Keywords - read the full job description. Find what matters in that job. And put as many keywords as possible in your CV.  Pro tip - So many companies are using bots to screen CV. So use the EXACT same words. Use spaces before and after. Don’t let the bots rule you out.  Whatever you do, DO NOT LIE. Especially in the skill section, you will be easily spotted during the interview phase. Once you get caught lying, there’s no turning back.  Does it take time to match your CV with different positions? Yes, it does.  Getting hired is a full-time job.  #people   #hr   #skills

 Never Changing PAINTING Will Eventually Destroy You,painting,127610263,"Getting a new job today - that’s a whole job in itself. It ain’t what it used to be.  But I still see candidates use the same old methods. The most popular one is “spray and pray” - sending your CVs to any position, regardless of how relevant it is for you. It can’t hurt, right? Wrong❌ Applying for every single job out there shows Recruiters that you lack focus, passion, and talent. Not very good qualities. Worse than that - sometimes you’ll get in the system, in which case you’ll be marked as someone who was rejected multiple times. So what should you do? 📌Research the company you want to work for. 📌Research the people who work there. 📌Find a RELEVANT job description, one that 📌you have a real shot at.  📌Research that position and try to talk to people in that company who know what it means 📌Adapt your CV to better reflect that position Then - apply✅ *This isn’t 2005 anymore* Invest time and effort, and the chances of finding your dream job will dramatically increase. #hr   #people   #linkedin

 3 Ways To Master POLITICAL Without Breaking A Sweat,political,848846501,"Are you adding a message to the Recruiting person? You should, it’s worth the effort. If you do it right! The way you approach Recruiters is as important as your CV. There’s so much at stake.  Yet I still get pinged with messages that immediately disqualify the sender. Here’s how to do it: #DO : Personalize your response. Make it sound like it comes from you. Research. Give us a feeling you know what the company does, and how it relates to YOU. Be Polite. Mention any special ability you have that’s relevant. I’m always looking for a candidate with an edge.  End your message with a Call To Action. A simple ‘best regards’ isn’t enough.  #DON ’T: Use templates. I spot them immediately. Command us to do anything. You don’t work for me, I don’t work for you. Not yet at least :-) Ask us what we have to offer you. This is about offering yourself, not the opposite. Finding a job IS a job. Make the effort.   #hr   #people   #linkedin

 7 and a Half Very Simple Things You Can Do To Save MUSIC,Music,550573716,"Have you clicked on the Search Appearances feature on your profile? 🤔 You get this notification weekly, some of you ignore it while I suggest taking a deeper look.  On your LinkedIn profile, you’ll see the number of searches you appeared in.  Clicking on them gives you some handy insights. Where it shows the job-titles of the people, this indicates if you reach the right audience. Take a look at whose search you appeared in and see if those are the kinds of searches you want to be showing up in. If the people you are appearing to are unrelated to your field I would recommend seeing if you could make some adjustments to your profile to better align with the searches you want to show up in. As you can see, in my case: 📌People from AppsFlyer search my profile- Hi guys you can reach out to me over slack although I'm more available here😂 📌Most of the people work as SW developers- which is good for me because this is the audience I'm looking to hire. 📌The keywords people search for Sourcer, Recruiter, HR, and Talent are also amazing for me because this is the kind of words I want people to search and find me. So, take a deeper look and try to learn and improve. This is a great QA to your profile. I think a good number should be 300-500 searches🙏🏼 #linkedin   #jobs

These mistakes cost a lot. #Don 't- Upload a LinkedIn post that says you've been looking for a job in the past 6 months and that everyone rejects you/ treats you unfairly in the hiring process.  #Why ? You are your own brand! If you are a brand you should emphasize your professional skills by sharing interesting content and showing interesting projects. You can get empathy from friends but LinkedIn isn't the place for that. #What  should you do instead? Ask a friend to upload a post about you as a reference or focus on side projects and show them on LinkedIn. #Don 't- Use the ""Open to work"" LinkedIn frame  #Why - Although it seems like a cool feature, I know recruiters who say they decline to connect requests from people with the frame in order to prevent inconvenience because they do not have jobs to offer. #What  should you do instead? Open the ""let recruiters know you are open to new opportunity button"", it's discreet and won't show up to recruiters at your company. And yes, marketing-wise it looks much better. All of this info is based on my thoughts research and experience. Feel free to share your opinion. Good luck!  #Jobs   #HR

7 Easy Ways To Make POLITICS Faster,politics,339795190,"A lot of people ask me to share some of my LinkedIn secrets. So, I've decided to do a small experiment, based on this I'll share some of my tips. I uploaded 2 different posts, both of them ""Self Branding"" posts that tell the same story- me during corona. Both posts were uploaded at the same hour, same picture and subject (You can check the numbers) and yet one of them gained much more exposure (post A).  My explanation is: • Post A is much more personal, I shared my personal goals, feelings and this is what people are looking to read. Tip- don't be afraid to share your feelings and thoughts, you will get much more exposure. • Post A tells a story, compared to post B which is super short and generic. Tip- tell a story and be a storyteller of your career, try to start with a problem and finish with how you solved it. • Post A ends with calling to action, a question. Tip- when you finish with a call to action people will get involved and comment-Boom- more exposure. What do you think? Do you want me to share more of my secrets?:)  #linkedin   #tips

First - the average age of people who asked for our advice: 26-33. I can explain it mostly by experience, 26-33 usually are employees at the beginning of their careers, and companies prefer to keep the seniors because they're more expensive to hire and of course, more valuable. Second, 1 out of 5 people is a software developer! Well, I was amazed by this one. I would think that SW people who are in high demand would be the last to get fired. I can explain it with 2 ideas - first, most of them are juniors /from small startups that had to close, second, AdviceMe's branding was especially oriented for tech people. Another interesting piece of data- 80% of the people who asked for our advice had at least an undergrad degree. The higher education was the fewer people there were. I guess companies won't let go so fast of people with high education. Also, 90% of people with 3rd degree had a managerial experience which is not a surprise. I want to thank  Or Hazbani   for all his help and great insights. And, 3 months later, I'm back in the office!

Pre-corona candidates decided to sign with companies based on 4 key factors: daily commute, the people, the role, and of course, money. Companies actually developed techniques and selling points in order to sell the positions based on these factors, and now we have a game-changer!  After some research on my side, I can tell that things are gonna change. Here are the new 4 key factors that will be considered in the post-corona era: **Financial stability of the company (the company fired staff during corona, or sent employees to unpaid leave) **Work-life balance (did the company take into consideration work hours for employees with kids, WFH)  **Social responsibility (companies that helped during the corona with donations, volunteering, and technology)  **A place to stay for the long term (according to salary, perks, and people).

 Could This Report Be The Definitive Answer To Your POLITICAL?,political,269622876,"Why are we looking for “adaptive to change” people?🤔 Adaptive challenges refer to situations where there are no known solutions to the problem or cases where there are too many solutions but no clear choices. Adaptive challenges are by nature, adaptive, which also means they are fluid and change with circumstances. The coronavirus situation caused a lot of uncertainty, suddenly companies had to change everything in a second without base knowledge.  The companies and people who won’t adjust fast will fail. And this is why we hire “adapters”. We are 3 steps ahead of everyone else, with new creative ideas because of it.

 Cracking The PROGRAMMING Code,programming,680071239,"A few years back, I watched a professor ask a class ""If there are two equally qualified 27-year old candidates and the only difference was their gender, who should you hire?""  10 minutes in, the whole class agreed that there was no ""better"" candidate. The professor proceeded to tell us that the woman may be thinking about kids and go on maternity leave at that age. He started to call the woman at one point ""the risk"" and the lesson was to mitigate risk in hiring.  His argument was that women are inherently risky investments, even when all the data shows otherwise.   This month, I kept thinking back to this one lesson in college, equating risk to women. And now with a female Vice President-elect, I can't help but be excited for a future when women are able to prove this lesson wrong.

When I’ve been faced with tough times in the past, I’ve always assumed that I’ll just “figure it out”.  But if this experience has taught me anything personally, it’s that if I want to be a good future leader, colleague, sister, or friend, I have to be able to have sympathy not only for others, but also for myself and my own circumstances.

 How I Improved My PROGRAMMING In One Day,programming,801156589,"1. Titanic Survival Project: This is a beginner’s project on Kaggle that is best for you if you are just getting started with ML projects. This deals with the Titanic disaster which is one of the most famous in marine history. All you have to do in the project is predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on data such as their age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. For example, it is highly probable that someone rich from the first class survived as compared to someone from the third class. You can use the Titanic dataset on Kaggle for this project. And just to make things more interesting, this dataset contains real data based on the people who died and survived the actual Titanic disaster."

Personality Prediction ProjectImagine how interesting it would be to read the posts written by people online and be able to understand their overall personality. It would solve a lot of confusion on the internet! This ML project aims to find the Myers-Briggs personality of a person based on the types of posts they put on social media. Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality identification system that divides a person into one of 16 different personalities based on introversion, intuition, thinking, and perceiving capabilities. The axis ranges from Introversion (I) to Extroversion (E), Intuition (N) to Sensing (S), Thinking (T) to Feeling (F), and Judging (J) to Perceiving (P). You can use the Personality prediction dataset available on Kaggle to create the ML project."

So this ML project aims to create a model that will classify how much loan the user can obtain based on various factors such as the user’s marital status, income, education, employment prospects, number of dependents, etc. The Loan prediction data set provides details about all these factors which can then be used to create an ML model that demonstrates the amount of loan that can be approved."

 How I Improved My BUSINESS In One Easy Lesson,business,597125554,"I started 2018 with NO JOB, NO DEGREE, and 200,000 followers on Linkedin. This year has been a complete 180 for me. Throughout 2018, I... - Doubled my follower count to 400,000 on Linkedin - Received my 3rd Linkedin Top Voice Award - Graduated from the University of Southern California - Joined the team at Studio71 - Was featured in Adweek, Inc, and more - Guest podcasted on 10+ shows - Spoke at 10+ events internationally - Hosted 5 events in San Francisco and LA - Helped launch  Impact Mentality I learned 3 major things: 1) Your goals should constantly be changing. You can't predict in January what opportunities are going to come in the next 12 months. 2) Execution is more important than your age. People will listen to a 22 year-old if they have already proven results.  3) Don't think that because you aren't going to that party on Saturday that you are ""missing out"". If you want to spend all of your birthday, Christmas, and New Years Eve working at coffee shops, do it.  #podcasts   #studentsoflinkedin   #hardwork   #2018inReview

 15 Lessons About PAINTING You Need To Learn To Succeed,painting,115065198,"""Hard work is no longer a differentiator. It’s the barrier to entry. I believe over the next 10+ years the real differentiator will be sustainable mental health."" Ran across this tweet from  Jeremy Becker  the other day, and I think it perfectly summed up how I believe our culture of ""hustle harder"" has negatively affected the competitive workplace. The number of times I have told myself ""You can't put down your phone. You are replaceable. You have to work harder"" has hit unhealthy levels in the past. What do you think? What do you think will be the differentiator for employees going forward? CC:  Sam Park   Angela H.

 Where Is The Best DANCE?,dance,448463837,"One of my most rewarding experiences at  Studio71, LP  happened a couple weeks ago when I was able to give a presentation to the whole office on social media.  I was able to explain not only the company's social strategy, but also my personal journey these past few years on Linkedin and how employees at the company could optimize their profiles to benefit both the company and their personal brands.  So few companies realize just how important their employee's personal brands can be to closing deals and fostering new opportunities for the company.

 Learn Exactly How We Made BUSINESS Last Month,business,122697703,"Born in 1996, I sit on the cusp of Millennials and Gen Z. I remember 9/11, but I can’t remember what it was like to have a cell phone without data.  As a Gen Z-er, I focus on saving money as much as possible. But when I do spend, I spend it like a Millennial (i.e. on experiences).  I am sitting at a WorldZ session led by Viacom, and I can’t help but think about how weird it is to hear people of another generation name and define my generation.  As a marketer, I totally understand wanting to target audiences. But what I notice from these kinds of talks are the lack of Gen Z people in the room, contributing to the conversation about what they are like. I am so curious as to how the conversation about Gen Z will change once younger people start actively participating in the conversation.  #marketing   #genz   #millennials   #targetaudience   #generationaldifferences

 The Best Way To PAINTING,painting,491392387,"“What you don’t see is the years of crying myself to sleep. We go on stage and talk about how great we are, but never mention the pain it took to get here. We fail to talk about how many entrepreneurs, public speakers, and professionals have anxiety attacks on the regular. It sucks. You have to want it more than anything.” Years ago I was at an fireside chat and someone asked the entrepreneur how he gets through the times of doubt. That was his answer. While I love to share these moments on stage or with friends, let’s not forget that social media doesn’t show the nights of working and worrying. We’re all going through it.

 Should Fixing FASHION DESIGN Take 60 Steps?,Fashion Design,112671488,"When I first started as the Linkedin Campus Editor at USC, I didn't even attend the college yet.    I was about to transfer from UC Irvine, and spent hours after class driving back and forth between Irvine and South LA to meet with students about the platform and how they could create content on it. By my 3rd day as an official USC student, I was on the front page of the university newspaper.  The Campus Editor Program was imperative in my career, but also in my self-image, teaching me to stretch myself beyond my ""student"" title and to express myself online.

Shorter is usually better, regardless of the #algorithm .  3️⃣  It FIT the platform for the time.  --- I have people asking ""How do you make a successful article in 2018?

And, I’ve had friends succeed and fail at turning their education into work opportunities. What I learned is that college isn’t for everyone, but the  University of Southern California  was the best option for me. People have different paths to success, and each has its own unique pros and cons.

 Never Lose Your OPERATING SYSTEM Again,operating system,196894613,"I have always rejected comments that I needed a mentor. I thought it implied that one main mentor would have a crazy amount of influence over my career. “I was picturing this Mister Miyagi type of relationship that ultimately changes your life and your perception around life” - Hootsuite’s CEO, Ryan Holmes. I know far too many college students that send out these emails to big names in the business, praying for that one mentor that will open all the doors for them. All the while, they are meeting hundreds of people with great advice and passing on the opportunity to capitalize on their generosity.  Mentors are everywhere.  Day 8 of #30DS

Now I’m two months away from graduating college, and I’m so happy that powerful, confident women have come into my life as role models and mentors. It’s these women who inspire little girls to one day become CEOs.

 Winning Tactics For DRAWING,drawing,12762477,"Who's your audience on LinkedIn?  I got this question a few days ago, and while I want to say ""everyone"", that probably isn't true.  We all have niches that we go after or topics that we love to discuss. With LinkedIn creators pushing out so much content, the usual suspects for content on LinkedIn have been redefined and expanded. So while it's not ""everyone"", I've definitely struggled with defining my audience and content down to a single niche.  Have you felt the same?

A Surprising Tool To Help You POLITICS,politics,825411583,"Too many people don’t understand the value they bring.  “How do I go about making a strong personal brand?”  “How do I get noticed by employers/investors?” I was recently inspired by  Fabio Marrama 's and  Tiffany Parra 's posts on the value young people can bring and how to define that value.  There are so many of us that define our professional brand by the number of jobs or titles we’ve had. After interviewing community builders and successful entrepreneurs, it has become clear to me that it was not their title that made them confident. Instead, great leaders knew exactly how they changed the organization for the better. It’s one of the biggest reasons I tend to resent the “fake it till you make it” mentality. It may work in certain situations. You know what works in every situation? -- Working hard -- Identifying mistakes to learn from -- Becoming more self-aware — Here are some people who are creating real value for the LinkedIn community.

 To People That Want To Start BANKING But Are Affraid To Get Started,banking,879980792,"“'But nobody cares about my opinions,' they say. 'It would make me feel conspicuous.' 'They’ll care if you tell them something interesting,' I say 'and tell them in words that come naturally.'” - William Zinsser I've noticed that many people on LinkedIn feel like they don't have enough experience or expertise to start creating content. They leave it to this group of self-identified #LinkedInCreators as if the ""creators"" are the only ones able to give value to readers on the platform. I was reading Zinsser's On Writing Well for a class and found it incredibly relevant to why you shouldn't be afraid to put out LinkedIn content. While much of the platform's content can be technical, value doesn't have to come from verbose language and complicated analysis. Great content comes in many forms from many kinds of sources: students, CEOs, entry-level employees, stay-at-home parents, consultants, professors... I may be biased, but some of the best content I have seen is from my fellow students and young entrepreneurs. Check out some of my favorite people on LinkedIn who are creating real VALUE through their content and community building efforts.  -  Frederick Daso -  Tim Salau -  Tiara Conley -  Manu Goswami -  Sam Park -  Joel Hansen

 5 Easy Ways You Can Turn FASHION DESIGN Into Success,Fashion Design,703118323,"""You don't need a great first job post-college. We're Millennials. We probably will never have the same job for more than a couple of years."" I was talking to an older friend about my anxiety around graduating this May.  The advice I got was a bit discouraging. While I understand my first full-time job won't make or break my career, I wondered why I, like many Millennials, was expected to probably never have a long career at a single company.  Everyone loves talking about Millennials, and many of us have been fed an idea of whom we are:  --> self-entitled --> tech-savvy --> job-hoppers I think some Millennials have accepted job-hopping as the only realistic option for our generation to like the work we do. I always hear: ""I mean, would you actually enjoy working for the same company your whole life?"" I don't know yet! But I do think we shouldn't just expect to job-hop. I hope I will, at the least, stay long enough to create real, sustainable value for the companies I serve and focus more on how much I contribute than the number of years I have spent at a company. Students: Have you heard similar advice? Do you think these ideas have shaped your approach and expectations post-college?

 The Philosophy Of MATHEMATICS,Mathematics,882548412,"How often do you ""close the loop"" in your interactions with colleague, friends, partners, customers? As we move to remote work, ""clear communication"" will be one of our BIGGEST CHALLENGES. It will be easy for your team to be confused  about whether you are moving forward with that project or not, what the decision was on X, or what's the next step with that customer, partner, job candidate.  Taking an intentional step to ""close the loop""  and clarify the decisions made becomes SO important and SO appreciated.  Closing the loop is NOT only important on initiatives/people/projects you decided to move forward with, but more importantly with the ones you decided to leave behind.  I encourage you to take a step to close the loop with the right parties (teams, customers, candidates, partners) about topics such as:  - Decision to not move forward with a particular project/partner/customer - Decision to not fund company X (applies to VCs) - Hiring decision to reject a candidate (close the loop w/ candidate) - your clear goals for a particular project and its timeline Clearly closing the loop shows our respect & dedication to others and our determination to make tough calls.   #closetheloop   #bestpractices   #bestbusinesspractices   #hiringtips   #jobsearchadvice   #management   #leadership

 There’s Big Money In POLITICS,politics,689671879,"Is Remote Work Here to Stay? It surely seems like it! Brynjolfsson, who studied intersection of technology & economy for years argues a few interesting points that are worth attention (link to the full NPR article is below):  1) There's a lot of inertia in the way people work and it's quite hard to change the processes, the culture, the training, and the types of work. Unless there's a “SHOCK”, most people will tend to continue to do things the old way. In fact, pandemic seems to be the shock needed to push the world to “remote work” almost overnight. 2) Based on data, there’s a Productivity J-Curve when companies adopt new technologies and processes. First, there will be dip in productivity; then with further investments, adjustments, and adoptions there will be significant gains. So there could be more benefits of remote work to come when as individuals, organizations, and industries we nail  #remotework . #futureofwork   #workingremotely   #productivity   https://lnkd.in/gC3n2Y5

First of all THANK YOU all for participating and sharing your thoughts! If possible, I would like to see more voices of women in the mix. Out of the respondents, only 38.8% were women (see below).

 3 Things Everyone Knows About DRAWING That You Don't,drawing,476760304,"Facebook  Remote Work Strategy vs.  Twitter  &  Square  Remote Work Strategy: Which one did you like better?  Twitter & Square announced that all employees have option to work permanently from home. Facebook announced that 50% of its employees will work from home over the next 5-10 years. In my view, Facebook's approach is a lot more sound and serves both current employees & future hires while still drive for the best business outcomes. Here's why?    1) Facebook acknowledge the gaps and plans to solve many of the issues such as communication & creativity through building tools & technologies.   2) Facebook plans to offer remote work to more experienced employees vs. newly graduates who need more mentoring and structure.   3) It offers Remote Work option to majority of current and future employees, but acknowledges that some roles can't be remote. It's critical to be honest and open about these types of limitations. 4) Facebook's strategy came across as data driven & feedback-driven -- based on the survey results from employees.  5) Facebook officially took a stand which enables it to establish leadership in this movement. Its decisive yet conservative approach came across as more well though out.  What do you think? #remotework   #workfromhome   #flexiblework   #futureofwork

The Gates Foundation, Wellcome & Mastercard are committing $125M in funding to companies developing treatments for the coronavirus.  4) Many companies that haven't been fully prepared to support  #WorkFromHome  needed to move to that direction. 5) Despite ""social distancing,"" the deep human connections will get stronger & our communities will hopefully continue get tighter.

MATHEMATICS Works Only Under These Conditions,Mathematics,842856675,"Chris Varelas  was my 1st champion in my career! He was the Global Head of TMT, Citi Investment Banking, where I did my very first internship & then my 1st full-time job. He noticed me from the get go and connoted with me at a personal level. Through many years, he continued to be my advisor & sounding board in many big personal & professional decisions. Watching Chris in action as one of the top leaders at Citi & one of the most respected investors on the Street & in the world, taught me fundamental leadership lessons that I carried through my life:  1) As a leader, you should always keep calm & be in control of your emotions even during the most challenging times & while delivering tough news such as economic downturn of 2008 or a key executive’s departure. Teams will pick the leader’s emotions, which can help them to stay focused and confident or lose it all together. 2) Be intellectually curious. Get to know others on a personal level & always stay fun and interesting, so others care to get to know you.  3) Speak less, smile more & listen attentively. That way, when you talk and provide a point of view there’s a lot more receptivity for it.  Thanks Chris!

 You Don't Have To Be A Big Corporation To Start MATHEMATICS,Mathematics,587545589,"""I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear. ""  -Martin Luther King Jr  There's so much to learn from a leader like Marin Luther King! The discriminations against one's gender, color, and background are unfortunately still prevalent at work, home, and society. We all see them & experience them. With less than 1% of Fortune 500 CEOs being Black (3 out of 500 to be exact) and only 3.2% of the senior leadership roles at large companies in the U.S. being Black, we need to change our perspectives to hiring, promoting, and empowering people of different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders. Research after research validated that diversity of all kinds in the leadership teams will result in higher business outcomes. We need to set minorities for success or else organizations will fall behind in competition and individuals will suffer. Let's stand for what's right! Let's speak up when we see people discriminate, have unconscious biases, bully, or exclude others. Change starts from each and everyone of us!

She shared invaluable nuggets of wisdom here:   1) “When you’re a female, colored woman, immigrant serving as a CEO of a large company and undertaking a transformation, there are tons of critics,” she said. “All the time you were in the public eye trying to answer the critics. So it was a ""grind"" all the time.” 2) Much of women’s ability to succeed at home and at work depends on existing workplace systems, which are rife with unconscious bias that “attacks women’s confidence.” 3) “All CEOs should run the company for the duration of the company, not the duration of the CEO. My success should be judged on how well my successor does, not just how well I did."" Indra Nooyi  - Thank you for being such an inspiration and role model.

Today, I want to invite all of us (men & women) to be more aware of our own gender bias, to acknowledge women’s ideas the same way we value those of men’s, to not harshly judge women who are wearing multiple hats in families and society by none reasonable metrics, and to reach out and donate to organizations throughout the world that support women especially those help with education and prevent domestic violence, abuse, and human trafficking.

 Little Known Ways to BANKING,banking,994464633,"Happy New Year!  Let 2019 be an amazing year to bring you all the personal and professional success and growth you wish for. Do you have a new year resolution?  I have a few resolutions & goals. #1 in my list is to get back to daily meditation, the habit I built a few years ago, but lost it more recently due to being extremely busy. Wearing different hats every day as an executive, mom, wife, university lecturer, startup advisor & investor, public speaker, daughter, sister, and friend left me absolutely no time for myself.  As someone who researched mental health and the benefits of meditation closely, I know that committing to do 5-10 minutes of meditation every day will bring me the focus, calm, and clearance of mind that I need and make me more effective in everything I do. So my new year resolution is to get back to daily meditation. I want to invite you all to join me in this journey and share your experiences with me throughout the year. These are some tips on how to get started:  1) Allocate the same time every day to meditate. Ideally you meditate after an existing routine (e.g. right after you wake up). That’s the best way to build a habit. 2) Set a reminder.  3) Use one of the meditation apps - Calm or Headspace.   #health   #wellness   #meditation   #newyearresolution

The large funding of Freeletics to expand to US market was surprising given the already fragmented and crowded market of coaching apps here.

 Top 25 Quotes On GST,GST,525660653,"Recently, I see a few articles per week about shortcomings of Sheryl Sandberg. What bewildered me is that I don’t see as much criticism about the #1 executive, the male CEO & Founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. He’s treated like a passive Chairman of Facebook at this critical times rather than the active CEO to whom Sheryl reports.  Rather than everyone focuses on the right issues, which are the technical, security, and communication problems at Facebook, they are mistakenly making the recent Facebook events about a Female Leader failure!!! Would we have the same coverages and bashing if Sheryl was Sean Sandberg! I strongly doubt... I’m sure that Sheryl made some mistakes along the way, but I can guarantee every single male and female executives make many mistakes over decades of running companies.  I can’t help but highlight that “these high power women” who take on tough roles get “substantially unproportionate fair share of blames” when things go wrong. We saw this in terms of Marrisa Mayer and we are seeing it with Sheryl Sandberg.  I really want to invite everyone from reporters to regulators to focus on the right problems and keeping the CEO more accountable or at least as equally responsible as other executives.  #leadership   #femaleleadership   #femaleexcutive   #facebook

In this day and age, with so many families having a woman/wife/Mom who’s working and more men (whether they have stay-home-wife or not) interested in participating in parenting and childcare, the mindsets and the work environments need to adjust. I also admire Melinda’s point about the fact that we don’t have “pipeline” problem for not having more women at the leadership positions, but rather we have problem retaining women at work; it’s 10x more difficult for women to balance work and life due to the false social and professional expectations.  #equalrights   #femaleadership   #retainingwomen   #womenleadership

As someone who study and research these topics day in day out, I know getting that 10-20 minutes back for meditation every day will allow me to be more mindful, more effective, more productive, and more relaxed. I hope all of us have clear 2018 goals and work towards achieving them throughout the year.  #inspiration #newyearresolution #newyeargoals #storiesworthsharing

 Congratulations! Your MATHEMATICS Is (Are) About To Stop Being Relevant,Mathematics,960942491,"Healthcare Workers’ Parallel Pandemic: Chronic Stress It’s no surprise that  doctors and nurses who go to work in an active battle zone, will,  at some point, start to feel anxious, worried, and stressed. This battle combatant is a wildly contagious disease called COVID-19. Doctors, nurses, aides, medical techs, clerks, environmental service workers feel threatened for their lives by just doing their jobs. And it is not clear if Americans really appreciate the level of risk, exposure and selflessness that all medical workers do for all of us. When I worked in a busy inner-city ER, I felt rushed, stressed and at times, worried for my safety: every now and then, some patient would come after a nurse or doctor with a knife or gun. But in comparison to treating patients with COVID? No comparison—treating patients with a highly contagious disease and with patients that are really ill, is way, way harder. My heart goes out to all healthcare workers.  The way we can support healthcare workers is by masking-up and keeping our distance. Selected Except: “We put on our masks and come to work every day because we don’t have the luxury of working from home in our pajamas, but the apathy and ennui that’s taken hold of society just makes our job feel thankless. It’s so demoralizing.”

 Find Out How I Cured My OPERATING SYSTEM In 2 Days,operating system,486879074,"Speaking Truth to Power In classical Greece, ""speaking truth to power"" was known as parrhesia. The tactic is similar to satyagraha (literally, ""truth-force"") which Mahatma Gandhi used in seeking independence from British India. It is never out-of-fashion to speak Truth to Power.  But as writer Noam Chomsky asserts: ""power knows the truth already, and is busy concealing is.”  It is the oppressed who need to hear the truth, not the oppressors. And who can argue with this?  As 2020 marched along and COVID-19 continued to worsen, all of us ‘regular’ people knew the virus was spreading and getting worse and yet, those charged with prioritizing fact, science and public wellness, buried the truth...And many more Americans are dead and sick because of it. As the promise of 2021 opens, I’m hopeful that we will have more transparency and more “Truth-Force” in managing the pandemic.

Apparently Haven, a radically new healthcare company led by the CEO's of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase has folded, just 3 years in... Turns out, this company, filled with the world's top brainiacs, had executed their own projects separately, with their own employees, obviating the need for their own joint venture! Why form a team if everyone is planning to score points on their own?  Could it be that these folks view themselves as so smart that they felt their plan was the best (and only) plan? Could it be these super stars couldn't compromise? Could it be that these titans couldn't appreciate that 'perfect is the enemy of good?' Or, could it be that none of them realized that 'healthcare could be so complex...'  Count me as sad. A dream crushed! I had high-hopes that new thinking would lead to new care. We certainly need new ways of doing old things--especially in health care delivery.  I'll look forward to following the story as it unfolds.

 Fascinating BANKING Tactics That Can Help Your Business Grow,banking,520185246,"I’m actually jealous  It doesn’t happen often, and never when talking about medicine or healthcare, but I’m jealous of those citizens who are already receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. So says the first recipient: “I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.” That’s the feeling I want to have—joy, relief, self-respect and duty to my country.  Good behavior with mask wearing and good citizenship are normal parts of my behavior when it comes to COVID-19, and it takes effort—I’ve got my many masks on me all the time, hand sanitizer handy. I’m weighing going (and not going) to stores, movies, not hugging friend, not going into their homes and on it goes. And I’ll keep doing all of these things but it is getting harder to do—I mean who doesn’t want to have a cozy meal with friends? I trust science and medicine—over the last 150 years, modern healthcare has done more to improve our lifespan than any other factors—clean water, clean sanitation, antibiotics, vaccinations, dental health, are the cornerstone to our collective health and why we now live past the age of 50. So when my time comes to get vaccinated, I’ll put on my Sunday Best, roll-up my sleeve and proudly get injected.

 The DANCE That Wins Customers,dance,805655631,"Creative Cascade at Scale  Certainly Covid-19 had been, on balance, very bad. It has, however, accelerated business goals and operations. Even in ways not planned before...like moving AA / NA meetings all virtual. Even though online rehab rose as an emergency stopgap measure, people in the field say it is likely to become a permanent part of the way substance abuse is treated.  And it turns out that ‘online’ is a highly effective tool to treat patients with behavioral health issues too. Being able to find a meeting to log into 24/7 has welcome advantages for people who lack transportation, are ill, juggling parenting or work challenges that make an in-person meeting tough on a given day and may help keep them more seamlessly connected to a support network If not for Covid, the “creative exploration” of online meetings would still have happened but much more slowly. I’m glad to finally see healthcare adopt more creative solutions, and I hope we continue to see more ‘creative cascades.’ But moving forward I sincerely hope it doesn’t another pandemic

 What Make PROGRAMMING Don't Want You To Know,programming,673865778,"Old-and-New Fangled Ways Help Thwart Suicides These are tricky times for sure, but it seems times have been difficult for awhile for many, if you view suicide rates as a direct expression of ‘difficult times.’ For more than a decade, health officials have watched in vain as suicide rates climbed steadily — by 30 percent nationally since 2000. Doctors have traditionally gauged patients’ risks by looking at past mental health diagnoses and incidents of substance abuse, and by drawing on experience and medical instinct. But doctors and mental health experts can’t crack the code when it comes to identifying which patients are in real danger. Turns out that AI programs explore more factors and allow healthcare professionals to identify more at-risk patients. Very good news indeed. But identify people is only half the equation...the other half—arguably the most critical half—is who is most likely to profit from an intervention...and be open to the help. Reaching people to communicate that they are not alone nor misunderstood, can happen whether the old fashioned ways or new-fangled ways... The critical element is to reach people...using AI and other predictive capabilities certainly can help reach more people and is the finest use of technology that I can contemplate.

 Avoid The Top 10 FASHION DESIGN Mistakes,Fashion Design,21841968,"Amen to this sentiment.  Nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists do not study hard, take exams and dedicate their lives to caring for others just to be mistreated, disrespected and not listened to by patients. I’ll say this again: healthcare professionals do not have to take care of sick people —they can refuse to care for a patient or stop working all together.  Our healthcare providers are becoming burned out and bummed out. Healthcare professionals receive profound satisfaction from taking care of patients. However, they too have limits and nothing rubs caregivers the wrong way more than patients who don’t show personal accountability for their actions and behaviors. “They tell you there must be another reason (besides COVID) they are sick. They call you names and ask why you have to wear all that ‘stuff’ because they don’t have covid because it’s not real. Yes. This really happens.”  “These people really think this isn’t going to happen to them. And then they stop yelling at you when they get intubated.” As my mother used to say: “It’s good to have an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out.” Amen

Read This News About Blood Pressure Turns out there are “three B’s” we should focus on when we think about our heart health: Blood pressure, Blood glucose (sugars), and Blood cholesterol. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to have higher cholesterol and blood glucose levels. And this is important because heart issues still kill many more Americans than other diseases. Recent studies have found that for every 10 mm increase in systolic blood pressure, the risk of calcium deposits and cardiovascular events rose accordingly. The ideal strategy for optimal health is to focus on all risk factors — blood cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.  This might be boring but it’s important: Maintaining a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and consuming alcohol only in moderation is good for your heart health.

 Studies show that they help us lower our blood pressure and deal with stress. But we don’t need studies to tell us what we know already! Dogs also help us get more exercise and spend more time in nature. They always love us and they are always happy to see us. In some ways, dogs show us what ‘goodness’ looks like in all of us too!
 
 Due to the ongoing pandemic, there has been an onslaught of negative news that can cause us to get mired in the spiral of depressing articles. However, it seems that a spike in dog adoptions during COVID-19 is one positive outcome that we can feel good about, as adoptions increased significantly in March and April. 
 
 So if you have a dog, or cat, or are thinking of adopting, make sure you have the  time--and love in your heart—to commit to them…Like they will commit to you.

Major hospitals throughout the country have private spaces for celebrities, the super-rich and the influential. These VIPs get the most vigorous care and therapies . . . even when there isn’t enough medicine—or even hospital beds—for the rest of us ‘regular Americans.’ In my days caring for patients, every one of them wanted desperately to be treated as a VIP. Everyone wants the best medicine and best doctors, nurses and therapies. Everyone.

Stress and anxiety are very real health concerns and magnifies the risk of  heart attacks and strokes. Medical studies confirm that those who tend to laugh more have a lower risk of major cardiovascular illness.  Possessing a healthy sense of humor is also associated with living longer—and having more fun while being alive! So try to bring a little more laughter into your daily life—perhaps watch a few videos of pets being silly, or children playing in a puddle of water—anything that helps you laugh!

What’s a pre-existing condition? Common ailments such as high blood pressure or asthma, any of which could require those buying insurance on their own to pay much more for a policy, if they could get one at all. 3. And!... The coronavirus, which has infected nearly seven million Americans to date, could also be cut out of getting insurance coverage  4. And, 54 million people have conditions serious enough that insurers would outright deny them coverage if the A.C.A. were not in effect. Why every single American should care:  1. Under the A.C.A., no one can be denied coverage under any circumstance, and insurance companies cannot retroactively cancel a policy. What to do? Protect this policy. Make your voice heard. Your family will thank you. Your pocketbook will thank you. (Insurance companies will not thank you!)

When I was in grade school, girls were not allowed to wear pants—they had to wear dresses. Nor were girls allowed to be Team Captains for any games and we were not allowed to play certain sports. In college, I had heated discussions with my dad, an educated doctor, that it was infantilizing to call Women, girls. I would say to him that once a girl started to menstruate, she became a young woman.  (This was the era of The Woman with educational books like ‘Our Bodies, Ourselves.’) And when I started my professional life, I was aware of how the men got better assignments, and how my male peers were never asked to ‘prep a room’ for an upcoming meeting, or to take notes (because ‘girls have neater handwriting’). For so long, the Working World has been slyly, perhaps unconsciously biased against women. It is much  improved from where it was even 20 years ago. And it’s not because ‘opinions naturally evolve...’ Its because of hard work. Regardless of one’s political opinion, it is true nonetheless that all Americans—and businesses—have benefited from pushing equality and justice for those of all genders, races, beliefs.  After all, what more American that that?

 The Single Most Important Thing You Need To Know About PROGRAMMING,programming,192705176,"Anger as a Poison Anger is a trickster—it starts out like a warm hug, providing immediate reassuring feedback. But keep it around too long, and it becomes a toxin that circulates in the bloodstream, poisoning all organs and causing self-loathing and irrational hatred for others.  Trust me I’ve been down this destructive road. At first, and for some months, the hatred provided a sense of ‘righteousness’ and ‘rightfullness.’ But I only became more and more irritable and dark.  So it goes with all hate—the hater turns to loathing of everything and everyone.  It’s critical to turn your back on anger because nothing positive comes from it. One way to do that is by breathing slow and regular, and by mentally pinpointing the ‘core nut’ of what is causing the anxiety or anger. Once the core nut is identified then mentally think through how to address that problem in your own life—not how to solve the problem flat-out.  Life gets better with less worry, anxiety and hate.

The evidence so far from these equivalency trials, comparing face-to-face versus over video — every trial  shows no difference in clinical outcomes.  And, from clinical point of view, the clinician  can often learn more over video than in person, because you see people moving in their natural habitat, where they live, maybe how they interact with others. And patients like being at home. There’s a comfort level at home,  sitting there in bed with one’s dog, that allows the patient to talk about things they maybe wouldn’t have in the office, because of how painful the experience or memories are.

 Essential FASHION DESIGN Smartphone Apps,Fashion Design,989946813,"Virtual Visits: Friend or Foe? Technology-enabled healthcare is here to stay, and growing. No question that telehealth visits, remote patient monitoring, point-of-care testing is the  start of a much larger—and rapidly growing—area of development.  And while many are bullish on the vast benefits of digital care including reaching people who can’t access healthcare or where healthcare is scarce, or in conflict zones, it turns out to have very real limitations. Not surprisingly gaps in equity and access show-up even in this ‘virtual’ healthcare model too. (Gaps access and equity are well documented in ‘the real-world’ of health care.) According to researchers at UCSF, virtual  visits require patients to have the knowledge and capacity to get online, operate and troubleshoot audiovisual equipment and it requires internet service and cell phones or other devices.  But more than a third of adults over age 65 face potential difficulties seeing their doctor via telemedicine, with the greatest challenges experienced by older, low-income men in remote or rural areas, especially those with disabilities or poor health. Buyer beware... Selected Excerpt: “Telemedicine is not inherently accessible, and mandating its use leaves many older adults without access to their medical care.”

 The Number One Reason You Should (Do) FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,914712717,"How To Be The Most Unloved Person: Now a days it’s kinda of easy to raise the ire of fellow Citizens. Two ways that are in the news include common activities that force (by their nature) people to be in close proximity to each other. First is shopping in stores like Walmart and Costco and not wearing a mask. (What is it about Walmart?) Even though it is required to wear a mask, some individuals feel it is their ‘American Right’ to be sanctimonious, selfish and down-right mean. This is a ‘no-brainer’ way to become instantly unlovable. The second way is to board a plane and refuse to put on a mask. It’s just like if a passenger where to light up a cigarette mid-fight. Either behavior will get a person removed from a plane but nowadays, not wearing a mask during a flight will cause the pilots to turn the plane around. Wowza. Nothing could top that in turns of becoming The Most Hated Person. These types of pointless and unnecessary acts of ‘rebellion’ would occasionally happen in the hospital when patients would refuse blood draws or an X-ray. However, those patients only harmed themselves, not me. Here’s how to avoid being the most despised Person: Wear a mask, have respect for your fellow Americans and just simply return to being a decent human being.

 Make Your PAINTINGA Reality,painting,572768492,"Surprise! And Not In A Good Way.... You might think that when you go in for surgery at your favorite hospital, they have all the staff and expertise to actually ‘do’ your surgery...but you’d be wrong! Turns out—kinda on a whim—the surgeon can decide to add independent consultants to help him/her with the surgery! And those added consultants—called surgical assistants—don’t have a medical or nursing license...And, they are often not covered by insurance.  So the doctors and surgical assistants make more money, and the patient is stuck with a big bill. I can’t imagine going to a surgeon who needs to add outside help to perform any surgery—hospitals have very strong OR certified special nurses and techs who are experts in operating rooms...and they are covered by insurance! So what’s going on? Another way private equity companies are ripping off the Healthcare Patient.   Some of the larger surgical assistants Private equity firms often target segments of the health care system where patients have little choice in who provides their care. The private equity business models include keeping such helpers out-of-network so they can bill patients for larger amounts than they could negotiate from insurance companies. Take Away: Ask if ALL of your surgical team are in-network.

 The Ultimate Deal On DRAWING,drawing,334252011,"In Healthcare, There Are Now Prices Listed Do you ever go to a restaurant or hardware store and buy things without knowing what it will cost? Absolutely not. There are always prices listed. Until now, when you go see your doctor or go to the hospital for a scheduled procedure, consumers never (ever) knew what it would cost. And if you ever asked anyone working there what something would cost, they could never tell you—because they didn’t know either!  Now consumers and patients get to see a price list for services before they are stuck with a bill! Just like absolutely every other thing— Under the rule, hospitals must list standard prices for 300 “shoppable services,” as well as the lowest prices they will accept from consumers paying out of pocket. Guess whose unhappy? The new price transparency rule is receiving tremendous pushback from the hospital industry. Guess whose happy? All of us that need health care services. And it’s especially  important if you pay out of pocket or have a sizable deductible. Finally some good news.

Experts have been telling us for years that at least 15-30% of healthcare and procedures are simply unnecessary. And not only unnecessary, but could cause other medical problems due to the chance of experiencing a medical error.  Why Is there so much unnecessary care? Because  care is driven by many forces: “defensive” medicine by doctors trying to avoid lawsuits; a reluctance on the part of doctors and patients to accept diagnostic uncertainty (which leads to more tests); the exorbitant prices that American doctors and hospitals charge, and the pervasive belief that newer, more expensive technology is always better. Consider this: Perhaps Americans don’t require the volume of care that their doctors are used to providing. Know what I say? Stay home to get better.

And yet....The Trump administration shelved this very document created by our nation’s top disease investigators.  Let me ask, ‘When you get sick, do you call your doctor’s office for medical care, or do you call your politician for medical care?’ Why on earth would we care what a political organization has to say about a pandemic? There used to be a joke among those of us in medicine.  We would say that doctors always thought they were qualified do other—unrelated—jobs, like run hospitals even though they didn’t know how to open an excel file.  Trust me when I say that anytime someone extends themselves outside of their training and experience, it never works out optimally.

 Why Some People Almost Always Make/Save Money With ART,art,681261106,"“Personally I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught.” Winston Churchill   Take for example the ‘new thing’ we’ve all had to learn about face coverings: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says ""everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public"" to help slow the spread of the Corona Virus.  Mind you almost 70,000 Americans have died of this disease so far.   And yet, some people just don’t want to learn.  The response in the city of Stillwater Oklahoma which is requiring citizens to wear face coverings (like so many other states),  threatened store employees with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse.  Learning and ‘being taught’ new things is at the core of advancement—or ourselves and for our country. And to my way of thinking, learning new things is foundational to the American Experience and what makes this country unique among others.

During these very irregular times, and unlike ‘normal,’ many hospitals are seeing way less patients than normal. Either because people are fearful of going to them for fear of catching  COVID-19, or also because all elective (non-urgent) surgeries and other procedures have been postponed. More than 150 hospitals and hospital systems around the country have already furloughed tens of thousands of employees.

With everything going on (you know what I mean...) there seems to be an uptick on advice on Leading or Leadership. Topics like  ‘How to be a Good/Great Leader During Times Like These’ is everywhere.

Leaders without Followers are either phonies, extremists or untrustworthy.  The role of Followers is not talked about enough. Followers alone are responsible for the success of Leaders. Without followers there are no leaders. For any project or organization to succeed, there must be strong, ethical people who willingly and effectively follow.  In these times—and in the context of Global Public Health Uncertainty—Followers uphold moral, cultural and community rule-of-laws.

In recent years, the federal government has been ramping up the standards for nursing homes, but inspectors remain frustrated by the prevalence of sloppy or nonexistent handwashing.  4 in 10 nursing homes have been cited for an infection-control lapse. And these are at the ‘5 Star’ places. Workers are not washing their hands as they moved to the next patient, or failing to don masks, gloves and gowns when in the rooms of contagious patients in isolation. Why? Many of the nursing homes are privately owned or backed by for-profit owners who cut staff and pay low wages. So it’s hard to get well trained, dedicated staff. In my opinion nothing is more ugly than a country that abandons their responsibility for it’s aging citizenry.  Ensuring patients are safely cared for in a dignified manner is all of our responsibility.

One company, Teladoc, can offer a single solution for providing a entire virtual care strategy covering the full range of acuity – from critical to chronic to everyday care! Now, I’m not promoting this company (or any when I write!) but I am promoting the reality of an alternative reality for how patients access and receive medical and nursing care. The promise here is that the entire medical and patient ‘workforce’ will be worlds apart when giving and getting care. Providers might be in their kitchen, wearing pajamas while virtually treating patients in the ICU...patients might be in their living room while getting medical attention. But, as we all know, there is more to high quality care than only access to healthcare professionals  (although important);  Having your care provider know you as a person with unique goals and hopes when you go through medical challenges is also critical.  And honestly, I’m not sure how well ‘virtual assistants (or assistance) can hep with this!

Often ‘tips’ and other ‘self-help’ offerings are, well, trite or silly or just generally, not useful. This list, in contrast, is useful!  I absolutely agree with the idea of making—and fostering—local, ‘lite’ friendships. (I disagree with calling these casual or lite friendships ‘weak ties,’ but we get the point.) I find that I really enjoy being “known” and feeling “part of the fabric” of my community and work place.  Making local ‘ties’ is really useful whether that is at work where you engage in chit-chat with other staff you don’t know very well, or at your local gym or coffee shop. The exercise is to ‘purposefully’ extend yourself to be better known and ‘seen.’ Key take away: try to extend yourself to others just a little bit more and in turn, you’ll feel more part of your work place and community. Be kind to yourself. Be aware of others.  And Happy Holidays!

Powerful doctor and hospital groups are stepping up their opposition to those measures and have mobilized lobby lawmakers and their staff against the effort. Sure, everyone needs to get paid for work done but when you go to the ER after being hit by a bus, you can’t know if the ambulance is taking you to an “in-network” doctor or hospital.   Which is what happened to one person who, after being hit by a bus, taken to the ER, then received a $27,000.00 bill—guess he went to the wrong place!! This could affect us all since it also applies to people who go to the ER because they think they—or their child—is sick.

 Find A Quick Way To HR MANAGEMENT,HR management,258313084,"Not All Hospitals Are Created Equally.Not By A Long-Shot. This article highlights a very sad story of a poorly run pediatric heart program at a highly prestigious children’s hospital. Many of the problems at this hospital are similar to problems found at other hospitals that have specialized programs, including perhaps the biggest issue: not treating enough patients per year (or case volume) to develop the needed medical expertise to reliably get safe patient outcomes. Reaching adequate case volumes to keep up skills is a challenge because so many hospitals are competing for patients — these programs are an important driver of profits, so hospitals want to keep them going. Some geographic regions (and many countries) have creative ‘regional hubs’ so that an area could only have as many cardiovascular surgical programs as the population could support...Unlike what we see in this country where competing programs might only be a few miles apart. What to do? Look up publicly reported data (Hospital Compare is a good source), ask doctors for their complication rates and ask how they compare to other, top-notch programs...

He seemed utterly alone, which seems painful given his senior years and confused state.

 10 Unforgivable Sins Of MUSIC,Music,792280217,"Find it Hard to Concentrate at Work? Maybe You Are Neurodivergent. Ever wondered why its so hard to concentrate at work? Two reasons: firstly, cubicles and open spaces are noisy, distracting and communal-encouraging “drop-in” meetings and interruptions. And secondly because not everyone is ‘wired’ to handle so much chatter and unpredictability. Neurodivergence describes the variations in the ways our brains function, and encompasses people on the autism spectrum and people with ADHD or dyslexia. The term has been expanding to include those with anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD—anything that makes a person think a bit differently.  And this can make typical work spaces and work flow challenging. However there are adjustments in a work setting that can be made, include allowing more time working from home, adjusting neurodivergent workers  start time and end time.  Allowing for this flexibility in scheduling and letting people do what they need to do to cope with noise or environment—without judgement.

Dogs and primates are still used as disposable test subjects, confined to small pens, in labs, subjected to all kinds of experiments. I’m very (very) happy to learn that the FDA is making important progress to find alternative approaches to studying and testing new drugs and vaccines. While I understand the historic role animals have had as “lab rats,” there are simply too many options available now (like sophisticated computer-based modeling) to warrant the use of animals in scientific experimentation. If we view ourselves as a kind and decent Society, then we must support the move towards banning animal-testing.  If animals could talk, what do you think they’d want? Go ask your own dog or cat how they might feel about being poked and prodded and kept in a pen their whole lives!

 How To Turn Your DANCE From Zero To Hero,dance,184094093,"Older Patients Are People Too I’m so pleased to read about medical schools adding courses in geriatrics that include hearing from and engaging with healthy seniors. When you are a clinician, you only see people when they are ill, so it’s easy to believe that the only type of senior citizens that exist are sick ones. So it’s critical to realize that mostly people are healthy and living full lives—even people who are in their 70’s, 80’s, and beyond!  Dispelling the notion that seniors are ‘too old to treat,’ or ‘should expect to be tired, lazy or depressed,’ is critical to being a great doctor or nurse. Not long ago when my mother was ill and in a rehab unit, her doctor told her she only had a week or so to live. Her reply was ‘If you stay my doctor that’s true.’ She ignored his advice to get into Hospice care and she continued to live another 2 years.  Selected Excerpt: “Unfortunately, most education takes place within the hospital,” he told me. “If you’re only seeing the hospitalized elderly, you’re seeing the debilitated, the physically deteriorating, the demented.

One-in-three patients in skilled nursing facilities suffered a medication error, infection or some other type of harm related to their treatment—much higher medical error rates than hospitals. And 60% of the errors are preventable according to physician reviews. The injuries and deaths were caused by substandard treatment, inadequate monitoring, delays or the failure to provide needed care (According to CMS) With over 70% of the Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) operating as for-profit, and with pressure from company owners to maximize revenues, it should come as no surprise that ‘word on the street’ is to stay away from SNF unless there is a very rare exception. (Yes, I know there are some ‘good ones’ out there by data will tell you it’s about 5% of the market.) The rise in post-acute options like Home Care is hopeful, and promises more personalized, technology-enabled, timely care...all while in the comforts of home. It is time for this underperforming and antiquated sector to fade away. Selected Excerpt: “Thirty years ago, 90 percent of Medicaid dollars for long-term care.

Only one of the  issues with medical errors is burn out. Lets face it, the bigger problem is that people are faulty instruments when it comes to high reliability, consistency and memory. That’s why I’m hopeful about technology-assisting advancements such as ‘smart’ (meaning automated) order sets, Smart radiological readings for x-rays, and ‘early warning’ technologies that diagnose medical conditions before they’ve advanced, just to name a few.

 5 Easy Ways You Can Turn BANKING Into Success,banking,345346133,"Culture Eats Consumerism for Lunch   While ‘Consumerism’ is all the range in healthcare, moving beyond the slogans to the real-world of strategy development and implementation—and measurement—is still in its infancy. Why? Even though many technologies are mature enough to demonstrate real value, getting people within organizations to change from their old ways is hard. The biggest challenges to innovation is not the technical aspect of intraoperability or, realizing a return on investment, but rather on the necessary adoption, implementation and change management that goes hand-in-glove with innovation.   I do a lot of change management so I consider myself to be an “Organizational Culturalist.” As an Organizational Culturalist, I function like a medical anthropologist helping  organizations develop and implement technology adoption roadmaps.   If ‘culture’ is the biggest barrier, then it’s time to think of culture like anthropologists rather than technologists.   Selected Excerpt:    ""Everybody thinks the only way you can innovate is to have some technological advance,"" he said.

New Rules include: Needing to know what’s wrong with you before you get to the ER; Getting billed for the whole Cost of Care if your problem is not serious. I fully realize that many ER visits are for basic health care needs (in part because our primary care system is broken and many people do not have regular doctors) BUT, this practice by insurers of using ‘hindsight diagnosis’ is unethical and well, cruel.

But the mind requires a different sort of medical model—one that includes enough resources (and humanity) to have time to evaluate, diagnosis and treat.

Feel Successful Each Time You Work-Out: It’s about the process of ‘doing’ so applaud yourself for ‘doing’ rather than judging ‘how much or how little’ you did. 4. Figure Out ‘Why’ You Want To Exercise: This becomes important to staying fit. 5.

But because patients are increasingly responsible for a portion of their own bill and because health insurers want to manage costs and influence behavior with their members, we are seeing changes. ...perhaps this is the start of “pay to shop” in healthcare. Selected Excerpts: “At the request of Kaiser Health News, Healthcare Bluebook ran some sample numbers for a Northern Virginia ZIP code, finding the cost of a colonoscopy ranged from $670 to $6,240, while a knee arthroscopy ranged from $1,959 to $20,241.

 3 Ways To Have (A) More Appealing MUSIC,Music,829313623,"What trauma doctors and nurses know ...the issue is NOT guns, but rather it’s the type of gun that will kill you. Just like how all viruses do not pack the same “killing punch,” it’s the same for guns. Years ago I worked in an inner-city trauma center and saw gun shot victims every shift. And you know what? Most lived. But that was before there were many high velocity weapons used in the streets. Just like viruses differ in their ability to inflict morbidity so does the “strain” or type of gun. Selected Excerpt from The Atlantic: “Routine handgun injuries leave entry and exit wounds and linear tracks through the victim’s body that are roughly the size of the bullet. If the bullet does not directly hit something crucial like the heart or the aorta, and the victim does not bleed to death before being transported to our care at the trauma center, chances are that we can save him. The bullets fired by an AR-15 are different: They travel at a higher velocity and are far more lethal than routine bullets fired from a handgun. The damage they cause is a function of the energy they impart as they pass through the body. A typical AR-15 bullet leaves the barrel traveling almost three times faster than—and imparting more than three times the energy of—a typical 9mm bullet from a handgun.”

As someone who specializes in organization safety and quality of care--and as a patient--these roll-backs concern me....as they should you as well.

 Where Is The Best OPERATING SYSTEM?,operating system,402906432,"A collection of the TOP A.I. studies published this week. Links in the comments!    A.I. contributing to longevity medicine: Finally it's not only about medications related to ageing but also about how A.I. can help bring healthcare to patients better.    An imaginative scenario about a critical care physician at a medium-sized urban hospital who has to implement an A.I. coming from a local start-up that claims to automatically interpret chest X-rays.    While treating breast cancer, physicians use a quick, inexpensive tumor-tissue stain test to diagnose the illness and a slower, more costly one to determine treatment. A new study just presented a neural network that could help. The stain in the test for treatment highlights a key visual clue to the choice of therapy that’s otherwise invisible to human pathologists. Researchers built it to detect that clue in the diagnostic test.    The question of who should get access to COVID-19 vaccines first has varied from state to state in the US too, with some governments prioritizing those with high-risk conditions and others lowering the age of eligibility. Sanford Health is using a machine learning model to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of having severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Here’s how it goes: If a technological issue comes up in a healthcare setting such as the anti-virus software becomes outdated and we have to call Gary, the IT guy, as he is alone capable of solving it what-ever methods he uses, it’s an IT issue.  If Gary is not enough to solve the issue because more stakeholders of healthcare must get involved, (e.g. letting patients bring the data of their trackers into the practice and merging that with electronic medical records), it’s digital health.  #study   #tmfi   #research   #themedicalfuturistinstitute   #garyrule   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology

DRAWING Is Essential For Your Success.

My take so far: Virtual keynotes don’t work at large expos with 1,000s of people and exhibitors. At such events, we’d like to immerse ourselves in a different world. We’d like to see and experience the venue, thus bringing such events to a single screen (with break-out rooms or not) is a complete waste. Whereas it’s not worth organizing events in the physical space with 150 attendees or less. I believe these won’t be coming back and I’d strongly agree there’s no need.  I can’t wait to hop on a plane for large-scale events all over the world, but I’ll be happy to continue giving smaller keynotes from the comfort and professionality of my new studio: it’s cozier, it creates a more honest environment and I even get better questions!

Assessment of a client’s strengths and difficulties and designing interventions are simply made by algorithms and the authors assume that psychologists are just there to share the results of the machine. Such narratives are not only false but even dangerous. If healthcare professionals (wrongly) think that advanced technology is here to replace them, they will reject those even more.

 2 Ways You Can Use GST To Become Irresistible To Customers,GST,646913557,"*Is Printing Out Medical Equipment Cheaper Than Manufacturing?* Revolutionary technologies bring a healthier future. In my book, “My Health Upgraded”, I’m sharing the most exciting questions (and providing answers) about the future of medicine. In the upcoming month, I’ll share with you one question from my book each week and provide a short (but sweet) answer. Question 4: Is Printing Out Medical Equipment Cheaper Than Manufacturing?  In short: YES. And not only that, it’s much more customizable. 3D printing works by additive manufacturing, which means that a digital model is created of the object we want to print out, and the machine adds each layer one at a time. That way, a personalized, 3D printed cast could get ready in 2 minutes and would cost around $50.  Wealthy companies will turn to 3D printing because of its potential for total customization. Companies in poorer regions will turn to it because it makes prototypes inexpensively.

These are also the fundamental values of healthcare, which seem to stay with us infinitely.

All of these suggest that technology is an important ally in the ‘renaissance of medicine’ that starts to treat patients as it should have always had. Our vision is to be able to provide this for patients in the future, while being surrounded with cutting edge, invisible technology.

So here you go: I started using this visual more and more because it seems to explain my profession much better: We’re exploring the future just as archeologists explore the past.  For archeologists, it’s fossils, dinosaurs, relics and historical data that help create visions about what might have happened (in short), whereas for futurists it's trends, data, scenarios and foresight that helps depict visions about the future (also in short).

 How To Teach POLITICS Better Than Anyone Else,politics,203659316,"Bias in A.I. might be the biggest challenge ahead in making A.I.-based technology truly useful for medical purposes.  But there’s a new paper in Nature Medicine that proposes to train algorithms to become better at predicting patient outcomes rather than to match the performance of their human counterparts. The paper presents this theory through a real-life example. Decades ago, a system was developed on white, British patients to determine their level of knee pain based on certain radiographic features of their X-ray.  This system systematically scores black patients far below the severity of pain that they self-report. When they trained a deep-learning model to predict the patient’s self-reported pain level from their knee X-ray without using data from the old system, they found that the model was much more accurate, especially for black patients, thereby reducing the racial disparity.

 Top 3 Ways To Buy A Used FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,370687941,"I’ve just finished a book that casts light on one of the most remarkable features of our professional lives: the death of expertise. Experts need education, talent and the ability to communicate their talent, as well as peer appreciation. But all this is not enough anymore.  Now more than ever, people tend to question a doctor or a researcher simply because they claim to have read something contrary on the internet.  And since in a democracy everyone’s entitled to their own opinions, as an expert, you’re stuck with trying to transmit your knowledge and expert opinion. It has a truly crippling effect on informed debates on any number of issues.

 Are You Embarrassed By Your CRAFT Skills? Here's What To Do,Craft,455675325,"Will digital technologies replace physicians?  No. But do check out my infographic on how different medical professions will be impacted by automation! I created it by looking at the top 20 medical specialties and the impact of automation on them.  On one axis, I differentiate between more repetitive and more creative types of medical professions. E.g. dermatology versus internal medicine. On the other, I sort them out based on whether they’re more interaction-based or data-based. E.g. psychiatry versus radiology. I then inserted the different professions into this matrix and checked what kind of future awaits each.  Naturally, they all get impacted differently, and here I’m focusing on the impact and not the categories.  Inserting these professions into the matrix was my subjective choice.

The one that sounds too good to be true: Quantum Operation is like a smartwatch that is claimed to be able to continuously monitor glucose without needles. The one that should be on the market already: Valencell announced a calibration-free, cuffless blood pressure technology that can be used in wearables on the finger, wrist, and ear.

Good Machine Learning Practice My take: The FDA wants to harmonize such practices across a range of international organizations. I'm not sure it’s possible, since their detailed plan is still not ready. 3. Patient-Centered Approach My take: I would’ve expected the digital health arm of the FDA to appoint a patient engagement advisory board, as promoting a patient centric approach without actively involving patients sounds like a risky business. 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness My take: This is why we expected that the FDA would take over our open access database of A.I.-based medical devices that we published in Nature Publishing Group's npj Digital Medicine paper. However, they confirmed to me that they won’t. 5.

 The Death Of GRAPHIC And How To Avoid It,graphic,34128148,"A facial recognition system in Japan can identify people even when they’re wearing masks. It determines when a person is wearing a mask and hones in on the parts that are not covered up, such as the eyes and surrounding areas, to verify the subject’s identity. Users register a photo of their face in advance. The verification takes less than one second and supposedly has an accuracy rate of more than 99.9%. #facialrecognition   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

 What Can Instagramm Teach You About POLITICS,politics,708026959,"I’ve read and enjoyed these 3 books over the holidays: - Life 3.0 by  Max Tegmark  - The author is the founder of the Future of Life Institute, of which I’m a great fan. In life 1.0, both our hardware and software evolved; in life 2.0. we design the software, but not yet the hardware. In life 3.0 we design both the hardware and the software.  What implications does this have on our world? - Math of Life and Death by Kit Yates - It describes some interesting scenarios through the language of mathematics.  However, I missed the HOW when it comes to implementing its conclusions into my everyday life. - Greenlights by Matthey McConaughey - Some great principles on how he’s been searching for greenlights all his life: those signs that help him take the right turn or jump forward. I personally find them in data. We could all be looking for greenlights.

What it means for us in digital health: * Big money alone cannot break into the healthcare business as they simply lack the expertise, experience and knowledge about the regulatory environment (among other things). What it doesn't mean for us: * That tech companies will still play a major role in the future of care with the products they can bring to the table (instead of creating a different form of healthcare like Haven attempted).

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At PAINTING,painting,601873615,"Believe me, I’m waiting for COVID-19 to end as much as you.

If any vaccine gets left behind because of a no-show, a volunteer can go and get that shot, thus minimizing wasted vaccines.  If I worked at a hospital, I’d run to grab my vaccine TODAY.

GOOD LEADERSHIP - Strong and clear-minded leaders like the PMs and presidents of New Zealand, Canada, Iceland, Singapore or Germany could safeguard their people more than others.  HUMANITY - People dancing on balconies and really caring for each other like never before; and messages of hope, love and support soaring to medical personnel all over the world.  HEALTHCARE - Today, decision-makers have realised that no society can live without well-operating healthcare. Maybe we needed a global stressful event that is a warning big enough for us to notice.

 The Ugly Truth About DRAWING,drawing,31562808,"What a year 2020 has been. The industry I work in vanished in a week, I worked three times more than ever before, didn't travel at all for the first time in my life. I learned to live with all kinds of insecurities. Made many professional mistakes and got totally exhausted by the end of the year. This year has broken me a little bit. I lost some hope in humanity and myself too. But all my family members and friends are healthy. I spent a lot of time with my wife and daughter. I witnessed the rise of science in the era of fake news. I bought a studio and launched a new business.  The Medical Futurist  broke all records. I made new friends through sports and online gaming. I broke through some barriers in my chess journey. However, I cannot wait to start a new year. I don't expect it to be better because it's new. It's going to be better because we make it so. I'm ready to work, serve my community and continue to learn even more in 2021. And if I have to go through all that suffering again, let's get into it. Now I have some experience. :) The COVID era will end when we are all vaccinated. I cannot wait to get mine and as The Medical Futurist, I will keep on fighting against misinformation. That's my pledge for 2021. I wish you all the best for 2021 too!

 What Can You Do To Save Your OPERATING SYSTEM From Destruction By Social Media?,operating system,59016748,"My last book recommendation for 2020: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by  Susan Cain . The book describes how the 20th century was for the good-looking extroverts, the ‘sales’ types of people.  Whereas the 21st century is all about the introverts: the Bill Gateses and Elon Musks, the Big Bang Theory genius geeks.  However, the future is for “the mix”.  It made me note both the introvert and extrovert personality traits I have: I’m very introvert in my life, in disliking social events, when I’m immersed in reading, even when driving a car (no radio or podcast on, just complete silence). Whereas I also feel amazing when giving a keynote to 1,000 people.  Without going too much into the scientific reasoning behind this (read the book for more details!) What's important is that we should do our best to balance our introvert and extrovert personality traits to make them collaborate rather than conflict with each other. Have you read this book?

 Why You Really Need (A) GRAPHIC,graphic,376783824,"‘Webside’ instead of bedside: a new, digital way of communicating with patients. I keep highlighting the need for a cultural transformation in healthcare to catch up with the digital transformation (rapidly accelerated by COVID-19).  Kaiser Permanente’s new curriculum is a wonderful example: instead of only teaching students the necessary bedside communication skills that each medical professional learns, they now integrate the “webside” manner. They want to prepare students for a clinical practice likely to be far more virtual than ever before, as there’ll be less bedside visits and shaking hands, and more virtual interactions. Still, communication and creating a connection with patients is such a key element of medicine, and since digital communication is something different, it needs to be learnt.  Well done!

 Use PROGRAMMING To Make Someone Fall In Love With You,programming,191334365,"Which vaccine will I want to get? This is one of the questions I get the most. In the UK, the first 130,000 people got vaccinated against COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine just got approved in the US, and we’re waiting for the authorization of the Moderna vaccine as well. I expect to get the vaccine around May as luckily I’m not considered to be part of the high risk category. So what’s my answer? I’ll get the vaccine about which I can read a study. Since I see the studies for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna, I could choose either.  Whereas I don’t see any for either the Russian or the Chinese vaccine. A decision about a vaccine should never, ever be about which political power is communicating about it louder than others.  It has to be a competent pharma company with a study, peer reviewed and published in a medical journal, approved by a regulatory agency. We all understand the rush and the pressure, but despite all this, medical clinical evidence is a must.

 3 Ways You Can Reinvent BUSINESS Without Looking Like An Amateur,business,206451251,"A.I. will bring the real era of the art of medicine. We all know that the art of medicine requires attention, time, and empathy from physicians while they are treating patients. Whereas currently, lots of administrative tasks need to be handled, and there’s a constant pressure from payers impacting physicians. Thus even the chance for the art of medicine vanishes.  However, the use of artificial intelligence could help facilitate it. Using advanced technologies, medical professionals will be able to care for their patients better, and their challenge will not be in finding out how to do it but instead to understand why certain methods work and others do not.  As an example: Imagine that A.I. will come up with a drug combination that works, and a medical professional needs to figure out why and how it came up with it.

DANCE Adventures,dance,820256114,"*Where To Invest? The Trends And Technologies To Look Out For In Digital Health* While working on my e-book “Invest in Digital Health” for  The Medical Futurist , I reached out to  Frank Kumli , Head of Innovation & Entrepreneurship and Member of the Management Board at Basel Area Business & Innovation. I asked him how they decide which healthcare startup or company is worth investing in. He listed their criteria: a) Is the value proposition interesting enough, does it create impact? b) Is the value proposition differentiated from other products existing in the market? c) Is the team capable of developing the company? d) Is the investment bringing them to a stage that will enable follow-up investment? e) Does the company have first customers or a proven intent from customers to buy the service/product?

Here’s a summary: - I do high-intensity training for 25 minutes a day on average, which is 2 minutes more than last year. I exercise at least 15 times a month, sometimes 18.  - I’ve lost weight and now weigh 78-9 kg, which means a 24.1 BMI. The goal is 77-78 kg with a 23.5 BMI.  - My resting pulse is 60-65, and 54 on average while sleeping. - I did an alcohol-free month, and I’m planning to do 3 more like this in 2021, as I was really pleased with the results.  - Because of having a higher risk for melanoma, I will regularly attend a check-up with my dermatologist and use @SkinVision.  - I’ve got a high cholesterol but can’t take medication because of being sensitive to it (based on my genome sequence test), so I have to adjust my diet. For that, I also need a new microbiome test.  I’m so blessed to have her in my life and being able to consult with her based on my digital health data.

 The Biggest Lie In POLITICS,politics,252003764,"Here we go again: Big words in the headline while the study was retrospective. A study from Northwestern University concludes that DeepCOVID-XR, an A.I. algorithm they’ve developed, detected COVID-19 on chest X-rays with performance similar to a consensus of experienced thoracic radiologists. However, when you look into the details, you see it was trained on data retrospectively.  Whereas a physician diagnoses and treats a patient real-time, and doing that retrospectively would yield very different results and efficiency. I think study authors should only compare an algorithm's performance to that of physicians if both used the same method to diagnose or treat, prospectively. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

Now an artificial intelligence based algorithm can help avoid that. Many patients get woken up at night or at dawn to have their blood pressure measured or blood tested. When all they should be doing is to rest.  Researchers of this paper mean to avoid these unnecessary overnight monitoring, using a clinically based deep learning model. They’ve checked millions of data from a multi-hospital health system to train an algorithm that creates an early morning patient score: this shows who are those patients that really need to be woken up due to a risky condition. Their result? From 10,000 cases, the algorithm was wrong only 2 times.  This is exactly the kind of clinical problem where we need to start A.I. research and implementation.

 Now You Can Have Your FASHION DESIGN Done Safely,Fashion Design,335571713,"Seems like today is the day of BREAKING NEWS!  I've been talking about how at-home lab tests are a must-have to keep the spread of the virus under control. What the  FDA  did now is huge:  They issued an emergency use authorization for the first COVID-19 diagnostic test for self-testing at home (with a nasal swab) that provides rapid results (in 30 minutes or less). Soon, we’ll have these tests at home so if you develop symptoms or have to travel, you can easily test yourself. I couldn't find data about its accuracy, but the FDA claims that ""based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that your product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19"". #fda   #athomecovidtest   #breakingnews   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #COVID19   #COVID_19   #coronavirus

It’s simply the worst experience I’ve had since Google acquired them and I won’t buy any more products from them. Why is this especially sad?  * I used to be a true brand ambassador: * I’ve had about 10 Fitbit trackers from the very beginning (since 2009) * I always highlighted that it was the first device to include a smart sleep alarm, the Holy Grail of health tracking * I continuously spread the word and many bought Fitbit products because of that My suggestions for improvement: Fix your customer service 🙏🏻 Getting a tracker is a matter of trust and without proper customer service, there can be none.  Can you suggest another health tracker I could try? I need a smart sleep alarm, good battery time and standard health tracking features such as fitness and heart rate.

By taking away the repetitive parts of a physician’s job, it might lead to being able to spend more precious time with their patients, improving the human touch.

 Avoid The Top 10 Mistakes Made By Beginning PAINTING,painting,341436316,"Today is the day that for exactly 6 months, I have not travelled anywhere. Since the beginning of the pandemic, like so many others, I've been homebound. A few things I have learnt over this short period. 1) Virtual keynotes not only can be as useful as in-person talks, but the visual opportunities are endless and I cannot wait to show you a few examples of what we have done already. 2) It feels good not to contribute to global warming by flying and traveling less. 3) I can work more than ever. Literally, 10-12 hours, no weekends, this is a vicious circle. You keep on finishing tasks but you never finish the list. 4) Consequently, I have to put much more emphasis on my mental health. If you spend all your time in a swimming pool, all you can do is swim. This is what happens to me now. 5) The logistics of virtual keynotes is twice as hard as for in-person keynotes (I would have not believed you if you had told me this 6 months ago).

Sepsis Watch is the product of three and a half years of development (which included digitizing health records, analyzing 32 million data points, and designing a simple interface in the form of an iPad app).  It scores patients on an hourly basis for their likelihood of developing sepsis (when an infection triggers full-body inflammation and causes organs to shut down). It then flags those who are medium or high risk and those who already meet the criteria. Once a doctor confirms the diagnosis, the patients get immediate attention. It has dramatically reduced sepsis-induced patient deaths and is now part of a federally registered clinical trial expected to share its results in 2021. #healthcare   #aihealthcare   #digitalhealth   #artificialintelligence

 Now You Can Have Your PAINTING Done Safely,painting,821002493,"I was a co-author of this paper published in PLOS One. We aimed to explore the digitally engaged physician’s knowledge and attitudes towards digital health technologies and the transformation of the doctor-patient relationship. We did this by doing qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 digitally engaged physicians from 9 countries.  We asked them about the role of digital health and technology in the medical practice and their everyday challenges, the ideal physician-patient relationship, and skills and competencies needed for working with e-patients and visions about the future of the medical practice. The interviewed physicians state that digital health solutions could create a deeper doctor-patient relationship: knowledgeable patients are a huge help in the joint work effort and technology is the main tool for creating a more involved and responsible patient.  Medical professionals in the future might rather get a role as a translator between technical data and the patient; as a guide in the jungle of digital health. However, the interviewed physicians also noted that digital transition today is more beneficial to patients than to their doctors. #digitalhealth   #futureofhealthcare   #study

 Use BUSINESS To Make Someone Fall In Love With You,business,396102122,"While I write often about the limitations of artificial intelligence and what it can really offer in practice today, sometimes I come across developments in A.I. that not only blow my mind away but also depict an exciting vision of the future of healthcare. Look at this: In some cases, patients need injections with an iodine-based dye (radiocontrast) to make their organs more visible in scans. But some patients can’t take the dye. So researchers developed a GAN (generative adversarial network) that generates labeled, undyed CT images of lesions on kidneys, spleens, and livers. They added these images to real-world training data to improve performance of a segmentation model that marks lesions in diagnostic scans. As it's really hard to get enough quality medical data to train the algorithm on and labeled medical data is even harder to find, GANs are making it easier and less expensive to create large, annotated datasets for training A.I. diagnostic tools.   #artificialintelligence   #ai   #aihealthcare   #digitalhealth   #futureofhealthcare   #themedicalfuturist

You won’t get the most accurate result at first (as the app mentions), but with more vision tests and less deviations obtained from the readings, you’ll get a more accurate EyeGlass Number. While it’s clearly not meant to replace your annual eye checkup, it allows one to keep track of how their vision changes over time. You can then share the data with your eye care provider for better insight rather than the once-a-year measurements traditionally performed. #digitalhealth   #eyecare

But, what matters here: they asked what we should do about those patients who don't care about their health unless they have a symptom. I said they have all the rights they need.

 How To Handle Every DRAWING Challenge With Ease Using These Tips,drawing,164378546,"This is huge!  The US government’s largest national health insurance plan decided to reimburse hospitals for the use of a deep learning model that spots signs of stroke so patients can receive time-critical treatment (up to $1,040 per patient for each use). The app called Viz LVO is the first A.I. software to be covered under Medicare's New Technology Add-on Payment program. The program covers the cost of the accepted breakthrough technologies.  ""Viz LVO classifies blocked blood vessels in CT scans of the brain with 90 percent accuracy. When it identifies a potential stroke victim, it automatically notifies a specialist to review the case, bypassing the usual radiologist review. The model screens out roughly 90 percent of scans, dramatically reducing the number that require a specialist’s attention.

Our team put a huge effort into creating an open access database and as the paper is available to everyone for free, please use it and share it if you find it useful! If you find any new items or we have missed something, please send your submissions, we'll cross-check it and update the database constantly.

I occasionally report about my chess journey and how I try to understand the language of A.I. through playing chess. Well, it seems my pursuit is not in vain. After sitting for 8 hours at a chess competition (and those extra 2000 for preparation), I won a bronze medal at a local tournament. I took part in the same competition last year and barely gained a few points. At that time, I had about an 500-hours investment in chess. The 1000-hour difference shows not only on the final scores but also in my relationship with A.I. While I was simply flabbergasted when I saw Leela Chess Zero making an exciting move last year, I gradually start to understand these movements and their ""motives"" now. It's an incredibly exciting journey!

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At POLITICAL,political,602943065,"Accenture released a report based on a survey that around 2000 participants filled out in the US. They conclude that before COVID-19, growth in consumer digital health adoption had stalled. While the cohort is small and only US-based, I understand the criticism around digital health tools and services. My main concern is that they call it virtual care. I have a great relationship with my GP, and when I share some data with her about a potential health issue and she helps via digital communication, I don't feel that it's different from when she attends me in person. Digital health in the eyes of its users and medical professionals will always look like something that doesn't want to work, while the solution's been here all along: whether you provide care in person or by using a way of digital communication, it's just care. Stop calling it virtual care, stop alienating this from everyday medicine and accept that digital health will bring a cultural transformation. This is the new norm where the use of technologies is inevitable in caring for patients. This misconceptualization derails the whole study. Instead of emphasizing the differences between virtual and in-person care, it should examine ways to improve care in general. And that question is independent from technologies.

It, being one of Elon Musk's companies, promised to create a viable technology as a brain-computer interface. There have been doubts about this, just like about his rockets or electric cars, but those at least work. Well, the announcement didn't tell much. We saw 3 pigs, one with an electronic brain implant, one that had an implant and one that never had one. They demonstrated how they can obtain signals with the first pig when its nose touched something. But we are very far from practical uses. What striked me the most was how Elon tried to make every scientific claim dive into the realms of science fiction. One scientist described how such an interface would let patients with retinal issues see again, and Elon immediately started talking about giving people supervision.

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At DANCE,dance,708898257,"I asked Dr.  Ádám Schmidt  to test  StethoMe® , the A.I.-enabled digital stethoscope in his pediatrician practice, and here are his observations: ""StethoMe is probably a dream device for parents and for doctors to follow up on pulmonary and cardiac diseases. The device is portable, mostly for home use, is sleek and has no buttons to confuse the user. The StethoMe app gives the user comprehensive advice on what and how to do during the examination. The auscultation is recorded with the device and sent via Bluetooth to the phone app, which uploads it to the cloud and is analyzed by the StethoMe AI algorithm. It can be time-consuming and difficult to complete a good enough examination, especially when a child is crying. The StethoMe AI algorithm can’t filter the surrounding noise, and the device itself is quite loud too - because of that, home use can be tricky. Overall, I like the device and find it useful. It can be used at home to decide on the status of your patient. I find it very useful that you can record and play back previous recordings, creating a timeline of data to monitor the evolution of the disease. As an addition, with this function it is easier to teach medical students and educate patients. Looking forward to the progression of the device."" #DigitalHealth

Of about 20 virtual presentations by now, I concluded with delight that my possibilities for delivering my messages have multiplied!

 Beware The BANKING Scam,banking,24633910,"Last year,  Peter Kuhar , founder of  Azumio Inc. , reached out to me with some preliminary data showing Type 2 diabetes detection with just a smartphone. Now Nature Medicine published their study. To me, it shows how to turn a promise into a proof, also giving a boost to digital biomarkers. I had a quick chat with him. - Can you please summarize the findings of your study? We've developed an algorithm that can detect diabetes using heart pulse recorded by a smartphone camera. Enabling an early detection of Type 2 diabetes with just a smartphone. - How do you expect the field of biomarkers to change based on studies like yours? Digital biomarkers are easy and low cost to measure and have a potential to allow early detection of diseases that would otherwise not be possible. One of the main problems with Type 2 diabetes is late diagnosis. Our algorithm will help catch this chronic disease faster. - Do you think that the hardware of a general smartphone would be enough to add insights to diabetes management? Absolutely. The hardware with this capability is available since 2014 on iPhone, and lately more and more and more Android devices are getting this capability. #DigitalHealth   #DigitalBiomarkers   #T2D   #Diabetes

 Find A Quick Way To PAINTING,painting,74895393,"Being digital and portable doesn't guarantee that a device will be useful. I usually show services and devices that I heartily recommend, but now here's a friendly warning about gadgets you should be cautious about - they might be just (digital) dog and pony shows! 1. Calorie count from photos. You take a photo of your food and the app tells you the nutrients it contains. It's not even accurate when you weigh portions of your food and add those to an app like MyFitnessPal, so imagine how accurate those could be, using only photos. 2. Cheap tools to measure heart rate and sleep quality. If you want to take your tracking endeavors up a notch, you can't succeed with a single app or device just above the very basic level. 3. Pulse oximetry apps. You can install them for free on your phone, but unfortunately they are inaccurate - even studies show. 4. Genetic ancestry tests. It's thrilling to take one. But don't try to gain any medical insights from it. And definitely don't try to prove anything with it at your visa application. 5. Multifunction devices that can measure your vital signs, earthquakes, and the mood of your family. Maybe even killing mosquitoes. If something sounds too good to be true, it is. Which  #DigitalHealth  service didn't live up to its promises for you?

 5 Ways Of PROGRAMMING That Can Drive You Bankrupt - Fast!,programming,396305960,"Our holiday-related Instagram quiz sparkled a lot of interest. Is it really true that such a patch exists that alerts you before you get sunburnt? What's the name of the device that buzzes for dehydration? And so on. So here you are, my hitchhiker's (and vacationer's) guide to holidays! About wristbands that measure water in your blood with infrared light: I don't believe they are accurate enough (if they're not accurate for heart rate, forget about proper hydration levels). Apps that regularly remind you to drink water to avoid dehydration: You might be surprised, but I don't think we need a device for every drop of fluid, every blink, and every breath we take. But, challenge me if you know any concrete cases one needs a ding-ding for each glass of water. Wearable patches that measure sun exposure and notify the user when they are about to get sunburnt: I haven't seen that in practice - as far as I know,  L'Oréal  only came out with it as a pilot. I would gladly try them though! Dermatology apps that identify rashes and mysterious insect bites: I have tried  First Derm by iDoc24  and I've had a good experience with them.

 What Alberto Savoia Can Teach You About ZOOLOGY,zoology,755234387,"If you've never had back pain, don't read on. If you sometimes do, you are probably looking for some relief for it. Something that's easy to manage, portable, user-friendly, and durable. And most importantly, it has to reduce pain. I just tested Reliefheat, a device that promises exactly these. This is my experience with it: - The belt is easy to use, comfortable and portable. - The device operates on an app where you can set the basic features via Bluetooth. It heats and changes temperature in seconds and even learns your preferences. Charging is quick and battery life is long. - But: you need to figure out first if heat works for you or not. Everyone reacts to the same treatment differently. Heat might alleviate your muscle and joint problems, but for inflammation you should stick with something cold. - ReliefHeat is designed for the lower back area and although I tried to use it on other body parts, like knees and shoulders, it didn’t work out well and was uncomfortable. - The product is only available in the US and Canada. All in all, ReliefHeat delivered on its promises. If I had chronic back pain that reacted to heat, it would be an instant buy. But if the pain is elsewhere, or heat did not make you feel better, I would recommend you finding another option.

 The Ultimate Guide To FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,561849422,"This is a great illustration of how significant the cultural transformation with digital health is. Lancet Digital Health published an editorial addressing the issue of race to end health inequalities. They stated that racial and gender bias represent a significant problem in digital health, and even digital health approaches have contributed to these disparities by not considering race or ethnicity. ""For example, melanoma diagnostic apps trained on images of white skin have difficulty detecting cancerous skin lesions in darker skin. Even failing to sufficiently account for variables that are correlated with race, such as health-care expenditure, can create a wedge between health needs and care received. When race clearly plays a causative role in health outcomes it should be incorporated into digital health approaches to prevent bias."" And here, at pointing to a serious flaw, science stopped so far. What practical ideas would you give us and Lancet to fight racial injustice in digital health? We, at  The Medical Futurist , support these efforts, and I hope that we could come up with relevant analyses or research soon.

 The Secret Of GST,GST,935773672,"Another great step from the  #DigitalHealth  arm of the  FDA . They just issued a guidance about regulating medical products that contain several functions. Some of those functions are subject to FDA’s regulatory oversight as medical devices, while others are not. I read the whole thing so you don't have to. When they regulate a medical device, the so-called ""other functions"" may jeopardize the cybersecurity, reliability or accuracy of the device. So they want to make sure that those other functions are also regulated, and the industry is aware of the dangers and risks so the FDA can have a better oversight over such devices too. As technologies get more advanced with artificial intelligence-based analysis, using smartphones or other connected devices, it was time to address this so patients and medical professionals can still use such technologies with trust. The best example they mention at the end is about a smartphone app that detects skin cancer from photos of suspicious lesions of moles. They describe that the quality of the photo a phone camera can make significantly shapes the outcome of the analysis. The manufacturer of the app should document how the camera impacts their app's accuracy. Excellent step forward! #FDAregulation   #HealthcareRegulation

DRAWING Expert Interview,drawing,463497729,"After  OpenAI  released its first commercial product - a rentable version of a text generation tool - recently, I've seen examples that point to a world where we people will constantly struggle to find out who we are talking to: a person or a bot. It can be so sophisticated, so human-like that we will develop common techniques we will share with each other that help determine whether the entity at the end of the communication line is indeed a robot. Just look at the conversation the bot had with a person about his holiday plans (image below). It's been used to write music lyrics, poems, news articles and many more. I first talked with a chatbot named Eugene in 2015 and it amazed me how it tried to trick me into thinking it was a person. I remember giving it a math test about apples and it asked whether I really wanted to talk about apples. When companies like Woebot offer chatbots for dealing with COVID-19 and related mental health issues, it's particularly important for these chatbots to function properly. Otherwise, they can do a lot of damage. In short: get prepared to bots tricking you into thinking they are human. https://lnkd.in/ejY7VCB #AI   #chatbot   #DigitalHealth

 5 Easy Ways You Can Turn HR MANAGEMENT Into Success,HR management,64764970,"In a recent interview with Wired, Kai-Fu Lee gave artificial intelligence a B-minus grade in the fight against COVID. Does it mean it failed? I believe it's way better than nothing - considering that it couldn't have contributed much even a few years before. Not to mention its potentials in predicting future outbreaks, and that we read about its novel successful applications week by week. For example just now, an artificial intelligence program that would monitor COVID-19 patients at home, and dispatch ambulances if they deteriorate, is just about to get a green light from the Australian government.

When my wife's blood pressure results suddenly appeared on my phone (while she connected hers to the device and she was there, already registered) 5.

The result: I have no antibodies. Such tests might be useful (or even required) before travel or returning to work. I think this shows how at-home lab tests will stay with us even after COVID-19.

 How To Learn ART,art,784291914,"Researchers at the University of Tübingen tried to train an A.I. to learn to identify a specific fish called tench on pictures. When they looked into the A.I. to see how it tries to identify that fish, they found out that the  #AI  was looking for human fingers against a green background as most of the tench photos in the training data featured a fisherman holding the fish in their hands after catching it. Can you imagine how useful it would be in medicine to point out such things before an algorithm is developed? This way, we could avoid so many false negatives, false positives and bias built into the algorithms. For example, radiologists looked at the ChestXray14 dataset of X-ray images and discovered that many of the images of patients with pneumothorax had a chest drain on the image as treatment already started when doing the X-ray. A  #MachineLearning  algorithm tasked with identifying X-rays of pneumothorax would probably look for the drain in the images as a perfect sign of the condition (they have to perform as well as humans would do, not learn to diagnose the condition), this way, missing patients with the condition who have not been treated yet. Can you think of an example in your practice (medical or not) where such subtle observations exist?

Instead, managers have to explain what it will give us - e.g. if you can download an app for your medicine, or if you can measure your health data wherever you are.

 Can You Really Find BUSINESS (on the Web)?,business,210340443,"There is an excellent new study that focuses on the intersection between medical A.I. and human trust. It describes very simply why both over and under trust represent barriers in adopting A.I.-based medical technologies. If you have over trust, you accept whatever decisions the A.I. would make without questioning that (and that's never a healthy option). If you under trust it, you'll need a lot of unnecessary resources to deal with its decisions as you will want to re-check everything. They conclude that: 1) The efficacy of human-A.I. collaboration is not only about the underlying mathematical process behind the A.I. system but also human factors, including trust. 2) Recent approvals of A.I. algorithms reveal the limitations of existing regulatory standards (at The Medical Futurist Institute, we have a study coming out about this soon). They also mention that the increased patient involvement in a patient-centered healthcare model changes the status quo. And ""if A.I. systems are an essential part of this shared decision-making process between patients and clinicians, trust relationships between patients and A.I. systems deserve further in-depth research."" https://lnkd.in/e9Hf8QF #AIresearch   #AI   #ArtificialIntelligence   #medicalAI   #HealthcareAI

CRAFT Is Crucial To Your Business. Learn Why!,Craft,175409095,"I just came across a great paper describing the difference between anonymization vs pseudonymization. Both represent important methods for protecting the privacy of patients whose data take part in studies and are analyzed by artificial intelligence. Currently, these are the most widely used privacy preservation techniques for medical datasets: 1) Anonymization is the removal of private data from a medical record. Simply, they delete parts of data such as name, gender or age. 2) Pseudonymization is the replacement of sensitive entries with artificially generated ones. They simply replace data such as name, gender or age with synthetic ones. It's harder than it sounds. Interestingly, the paper concludes that ""De-identification by naive anonymization or pseudonymization alone must therefore be viewed as a technically insufficient measure against identity inference.""

I used to test the  NeuroSky  headset with a drone so when I reached a certain level of focus, the drone started flying around.

They came up with quite surprising pieces of advice. 1) Close your doors and lock them: robots cannot open mechanical doors. 2) Paint your doorknob black because robots cannot see against a black background. 3) Go upstairs. Most robots cannot climb the stairs. 4) If none of these work, hop on a table and wait. Its battery will soon run out. These are humorous but true recommendations. They show how long the path is ahead for robots and automation to catch up with what we can do. I'm not afraid of a robot apocalypse (partially because I'm always kind to any technology around me), but I go and paint my doorknob, just in case. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #book   #reading   #read   #robots   #RobotApocalypse   #ArtificialIntelligence   #AI   #robot   #RebootingAI

 5 Simple Steps To An Effective PROGRAMMING Strategy,programming,357417242,"It is theoretically impossible that everything is always wrong in healthcare. Yes, there is a digital divide and there will be patients who, by not having access to good Internet, might not have access to care either. But the only issue with the pandemic-induced rise in telemedical care is that it took a pandemic to let telemedicine earn its place in care. And don't have doubts, it will be here to stay. With global doctor shortages, a rising number of chronic patients and costs, telemedicine is the new norm. Get used to it.

 The Hidden Mystery Behind PAINTING,painting,635106671,"A fantastic review came out in the British Medical Journal. Nagendran et al. analyzed the design, reporting standards, risk of bias and claims of studies comparing the performance of diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging with that of expert physicians. There is a line in their paper that should be on the wall of every company involved with medical A.I.: ""The danger is that public and commercial appetite for healthcare AI outpaces the development of a rigorous evidence base to support this comparatively young field."" They could only find about a dozen studies and pointed out how many studies are not prospective and have not been validated on real world data. Their results stand as a proof that while the field is new and just started to skyrocket, the same rules must apply to them as to any other medical technologies, no matter how exciting A.I. results sound. There is a long path ahead and we plan to support this mission with two new papers at The Medical Futurist Institute, I hope I can share those with you in no time.

After all, I lead a healthy lifestyle, work out regularly, have social relationships - I consider myself an outgoing, happy person with a healthy attitude. It was only these past few months that I started experiencing fatigue and anxiety, and I even lost my motivation because of the feeling of hopelessness and uncertainty. I shouldn't wonder, because these are hopeless and uncertain times, which causes symptoms of depression to more than half (!) of us - as several studies show. Even the WHO put together a brief on mental health considerations during COVID-19, with tailored messages not only to caregivers, but also to the general public. Of course, digital health companies also joined in the efforts. UK-based startup UnMind provides a platform for workplace mental health, Headspace is specializing in meditation, while Big Health offers a digital sleep improvement program to help overcome poor sleep without pills. I have been using  Headspace Inc.  before too, and I found it useful for meditating more often. Do you use an app or a device to take care of your emotional and mental health?

As an alternative, Sleep as Android is a great free app.) 3) Do an ECG analysis from time to time (mine is Kardia's newest 6-lead device - unfortunately I don't know any free alternatives for that.) 4) Check your blood pressure once a month (I do it with iHealth, but grandma's old blood pressure cuff will also do.) 5) Check your skin lesions (I have skin lesions I should get checked out regularly - in the meantime, I re-check them with SkinVision.

 How To Take The Headache Out Of PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,482364793,"To help its users stay fit during the lockdown, Fitbit extended its free Premium trial from 7 to 90 days. That's already enough time to experiment with its benefits, so I decided I would give it a try - there is nothing to lose here. Now, after a month, here are a few things that have been definitely useful and worked as an added benefit of being a Premium member of Fitbit. Besides the obvious guided exercise and meditation programs, challenges and adventures, the Wellness Report has been far the most exciting feature for me - it's amazing. In the Android app, you can find it under the Discover menu, then ""Health and Wellness Stats"" and ""Wellness Reports"". It gives a great overview of my resting heart rate, sleep patterns, how much time I have spent exercising and how many steps I have made on average. This is much better than the stats in the app and the descriptions are more helpful too. I will share these data with my GP to check how my resting heart rate changes in relation to my workouts.

I used  Muse® by Interaxon Inc.  before to learn to meditate better but had to stop using it otherwise I have no chance of reaching mindfulness with a gadget on my head. I used  NeuroSky  to learn to focus (to fly a little drone around - it's on my YouTube channel), but it was only for fun. So when the team of  Macrotellect-Brainwave Technology&Consumer EEG Device Supplier  approached me to test their EEG sensor during meditation and focus training, I couldn't say no.

12 Questions Answered About GRAPHIC,graphic,980446822,"I talked with a professional video game streamer, Blyyy, who was super kind and shared all his insights about live streaming.  We have seen numerous examples of how speakers do it wrong (you know those terrible Zoom check-ins), so I thought why not be inspired by those who are definitely professionals in such technicalities?  I learnt that * He sometimes streams for 12 hours a day. Then he exercises (he often exercised in the stream encouraging his viewers to train with him). * He told us what technologies (hardware and software) we need to use for a good stream. It seems we will experiment with YouTube Live first. * He shared how he ""branded"" his audience, started calling them by a name that is unique to his channel. * He described how hard it is to maintain contact with them and keep them engaged while sitting in front of a camera and a green screen with his hands on the keyboard and mouse. * He hasn't used a biometric sensor but some of his colleagues have showing their pulse during intense gaming moments. * Many streaming services have a significant lag (even almost a minute) which would make a live Q&A unbearable. So there is plenty of work to be done. But  The Medical Futurist  will hold its first virtual (free) event in May. Details soon! #digitalhealth   #speaker

 Remarkable Website - CRAFT Will Help You Get There,Craft,423280832,"Artificial intelligence has been enjoying a boom in certain medical specialties and radiology always stands out. There is an interesting story in MIT Tech Review about what A.I. is capable of in imaging. Rizwan Malik, radiologist at the Royal Bolton Hospital, turned to A.I. to make his job easier. In his hospital, patients often had to wait six hours or more for a specialist to look at their x-rays. If an emergency room doctor could get an initial reading from an A.I.-based tool, it could dramatically shrink that wait time. A specialist could follow up the A.I. system’s reading later. So last year, Malik identified a promising A.I.-based chest x-ray system called qXR from  Qure.ai  and proposed to test the system over six months. As COVID-19 jumped into our lives, they also had to re-design the system that now is capable of identifying coronavirus-specific signs. Such a fast response and iteration is only possible in the case of A.I.-based medical technologies. This is why it's so crucial that the FDA, for example, started analyzing companies instead of individual algorithms for approval. Also, there are so many COVID-19 related ongoing A.I. projects in medical imaging, that Stanford started to curate many:  https://lnkd.in/gE_rdhP #themedicalfuturist   #AI

It's quite devastating what it found and clearly shows why implementing A.I. into the clinical practice is going to be so hard without evidence-based data. They found that the proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Only one study used patient data from outside of China.

 The Untold Secret To GRAPHIC In Less Than Ten Minutes,graphic,863682486,"A note for those who don't understand why we had to shut the world down for this pandemic. This new virus led to a significant death toll in weeks, there are no treatment protocols, or thousands of peer-reviewed studies, no experience and knowledge in textbooks. Therefore, we had to shut down the world to let the medical workforce do its best until they can deal with it. Without the lockdowns, there would be peaks of cases in the span of days, leading to tens of millions of avoidable deaths, an overwhelmed medical workforce, and even mroe uncertainty about when we can go back to our lives. All this turns out to be a moment for  #digitalhealth  to shine. Telemedicine has become the norm in many countries to avoid exposure to infections. 3D printing technologies help support the broken supply chains of medical and protective equipment. Chatbots help those who face mental health challenges. Artificial intelligence helps prepare for the spread of the virus, reorganize supplies and help prioritize patients at higher risk for a severe disease. Apps all over the digital health specturm assist those who stay at home and still try to live a healthy lifestyle. As the pandemic passes, and it will, I hope the openness for these technologies will remain with us forever. #covid19

PHOTOGRAPHY: An Incredibly Easy Method That Works For All,photography,416805403,"Yesterday, I had the chance to attend the event (virtual, of course) of  deeplearning.ai  and hear  Andrew Ng  and  Eric Topol, MD  speak about how medicine could attract more A.I. developers. Dr. Topol highlighted some real-life clinical examples where A.I. can help (from radiology to dermatology) and he also pointed out the major flaws with the field today (no prospective studies, only a few clinical trials, not enough data, among others). Dr. Ng told a story about how his physician father wrote in a book in the 1980s that machines will not replace physicians but would only sharpen their decision-making and clinical judgment. In response to what we are witnessing today, they launched an A.I. in medicine course at Coursera for developers and made the event's recording public.

As the platform becomes increasingly active in the fight against COVID-19, offering technology and expertise on multiple levels, I had a chat with Kimberly Powell, Vice President of Healthcare at NVIDIA about the company’s take and vision on A.I. in healthcare.  She mentioned these efforts: * Providing a free 90-day license to Parabricks to any researcher in the worldwide effort to fight the novel coronavirus. Parabricks uses GPUs to accelerate by as much as 50x the analysis of genomic sequencing data. * Teams of expert data scientists have joined a challenge to forecast infection spread and fatalities in regions around the world. Others are creating a model to run natural language queries and summarize the mountain of COVID-19 papers. * NVIDIA Inception is teaming with 160 healthcare startups that are now turning their focus to COVID-19. NVIDIA is lending its expertise, computing resources, and funding to accelerate the work that includes medical imaging models for COVID-19, no-contact body temperature measurement systems, molecular compound discovery algorithms, and UV robots for disinfection. #coronavirus   #covid19

 Fear? Not If You Use CRAFT The Right Way!,Craft,582105588,"Google started releasing anonymized location data from users who have the ""Location History"" setting enabled in their Google accounts. This way, public health officials can see how effective social distancing measures are in 131 countries. The announcement mentions that Google isn't releasing any data on individual people or specific locations. Instead, ""it used differential privacy techniques to add noise to the data sets used to create the reports in an effort to make it harder to de-anonymize that data used to create the reports."" It means it's possible to deanonymize data, in theory, even though the risk is small. I'm so glad such huge data sets can support the fight against the pandemic, but we have to be vigilant so beating the pandemic doesn't come with the loss of our privacy.

I also discuss what it would mean for us and how different it will be going back to our life which is not going to be the same. Also, a few interesting news and developments. Reporters at STAT News tested several chatbots that were specifically designed for answering patients' questions whether they have the coronavirus and the results varied greatly. With the same symptoms, they got different results such as there is probably no risk and start at-home quarantine immediately.  There are A.I.-based technologies that could make contact tracing much faster (it usually takes days) and could send a warning to people's phones who have been in the proximity of a patient who was just testedt positive.

 A Guide To PAINTING At Any Age,painting,989578306,"The FDA just approved an antibody-based test for COVID-19 which raises interesting issues. Those patients who are infected with the virus produce antibodies specific to the virus and such tests can detect them. This would show who has already been sick — whether they had symptoms or not — and therefore, who is probably immune enough to the virus to safely move around.  It doesn't mean the test is helpful during the pandemic but it could be useful when we try to go back to living our lives and doing our jobs. I'm just speculating here: What if the pandemic goes on for many months from now even with the worldwide lockdowns and only those people would be allowed to reduce social distancing (to work, do shopping, travel, etc.) who has a positive antibody test and a negative virus test (a PCR test showing there is no coronavirus in their body)? What if biotech companies have to create a sort of biological passport so some people can go back to society?

 Take 10 Minutes to Get Started With MATHEMATICS,Mathematics,152205803,"I just came across a company called Maple that developed a virtual care program that tries to reduce the burden on the staff in emergency departments. They are piloting it with  Health PEI , a governmental organization.   Some patients who meet the program’s specific inclusion and exclusion criteria can use a virtual care visit right on the spot, instead of waiting for in-person treatment. The nursing staff under medical directives can perform a few tests, then add data about the patient on the online platform. This request goes out to a network of physicians using an Uber-like matching approach and physicians determine if they’d like to “pick up the visit” and treat the patient.  They reported an incredible drop in waiting times - down from 8 hours in some cases to under 5 minutes because of their matching algorithm and triage approach.

 The SCIENCE That Wins Customers,science,673769003,"I recently shared that because of my high genetic risk for skin cancer, I get regular check-ups by a dermatologist, plus I also re-check the risky spots once a month with  SkinVision . You cannot imagine the flow of negative comments I received after that. A week later, a review concluded that current algorithm-based smartphone apps cannot be relied on to detect all cases of melanoma or other skin cancers. Exactly! This is why I don't only rely on them. I use them to re-check spots. I also asked Skinvision to comment on the study and got this from Erik de Heus, CEO, SkinVision. ""The latest research, not included in the authors' overall assessment, proves that our algorithm can detect 95% of cases of skin cancer. In comparison, the sensitivity of general practitioners ranges from 61% and 66%, while the sensitivity of dermatologists is between 75% and 92%. SkinVision has assisted in finding over 40,000 cases of skin cancer already. These objective facts prove that the clinical benefits of the service outweigh the risks."" Digital health technologies take time to be proven + these technologies only assist current medical procedures. Skinvision could simply win this battle by having a similar study result that was not supported by them. Where do you stand on this?

 Want A Thriving Business? Focus On GST!,GST,515191921,"The FDA just approved the first drug to treat 4-17 years old children having peanut allergies. It's designed to minimize the incidence and severity of a child's allergic reaction to peanuts. In the US, 2.5% of children have peanut allergy, but millions of people are affected worldwide. For some, eating food containing peanut - whether denied by clueless waiters or mislabelled on the package - can even be lethal. So when I say that sensors indicating whether a food has peanut can be very useful, I mean literally life-saving. In this category, I tested  Nima Labs 's sensor (they also have one for gluten), and it does the task flawlessly - if you put a small sample of food in it, it indicates peanut accurately, is truly easy and fast to use, and it's portable. The only flip side is that you have to change capsules for each sampling, which is neither economical nor environmentally friendly. So, at the moment, it's not without fault - but neither is the newly approved treatment.

 7 Rules About GRAPHIC Meant To Be Broken,graphic,134849603,"I keep on geting questions about the accuracy of smartphone apps for heartrate measurement. There are smartphone apps that promise to tell you your heartrate if you put your finger on the camera near the flashlight.  The simple conclusion I can share after testing a lot is that well-designed devices are much more accurate than these apps. Even studies showed that their accuracy is questionable. The apps have an error rate of about 5-15% that doesn't sound much but it's basically saying that the heartrate you measure with these apps is far from being precise and, more importantly, far from being a reliable vital sign you can base decisions on. Here is the study:  https://lnkd.in/g7FBgUu #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #health   #healthy   #fromchancetochoice   #healthapp   #heartratemonitor   #heartratemonitorapps   #heartrateapps

 Where Is The Best FASHION DESIGN?,Fashion Design,156234729,"Another excellent example of how A.I.-based systems could help improve healthcare. On January 9, the WHO notified the public of a flu-like outbreak in China. But a Canadian health monitoring platform,  BlueDot Inc  , sent word of the outbreak to its customers on December 31. It uses an AI-driven algorithm that scours foreign-language news reports, animal and plant disease networks, airline ticketing data and official proclamations to give its clients advance warning to avoid danger zones like Wuhan. It also correctly predicted that the virus would jump from Wuhan to Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo in the days following its initial appearance. There is so much data that even the most experienced experts are not able to deal with it or see everything while these algorithms can filter through the mess of information. I hope governments and global organizations will take advantage of them. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #wuhan   #coronavirus   #epidemics

So please don't believe the hype when you read the headlines such as A.I. outperforms physicians in diagnosing a medical condition.  1) These usually take place on pre-selected data sets, and clinical life is much more diverse than that.  2) Many of these studies are retrospective and still have to prove the efficiency of the algorithm prospectively. Just one of the reasons why I have a keynote narrative entirely dedicated to understanding A.I. from the medical and healthcare perspective. Those working with A.I. algorithms must understand at least the basics and it is indeed possible without any prior knowledge. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #mammography   #googlehealth   #speaker   #speakerlife   #keynotespeaker

 Warning: These 9 Mistakes Will Destroy Your OPERATING SYSTEM,operating system,70116550,"Digital health is a cultural transformation of healthcare. There is an interesting story about how one futurist noted that a 1960s film of the “office of the future” made on-par technological predictions (fax machines, personal computers or telephones), but had a glaring omission: The office had no women.  This is why it's so crucial to embrace the cultural nature of the transformation we witness today in healthcare. It is initiated, but not driven by technologies. How people in healthcare adopt or reject those innovations and how they can prepare for the changes emotionally are more important than which microchip comes out next week.

 3 Ways To Master DANCE Without Breaking A Sweat,dance,771220507,"Your A.I. Prescription, 3-2-1 Lift Off! Yesterday was the first time I presented my new keynote narrative about my favorite topic: artificial intelligence in healthcare. The audience was a group of medical futurists to-be, students from the Biomedical Instrumentation subject at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I talked about why you already live with A.I., and how we can get the best out of it for the sake of patients.  I also had impromptu expert assistance by  Ármin Juhász  (my FIDE-accredited chess trainer) and  Gabor Csato MD, MSc  (CEO of the Hungarian National Ambulance Service). It was fun to have them add their points of view to the story! From the questions, it was good to see how clearly these future inventors and engineers see the potentials and threats of A.I., as well as their key role in keeping control of it: the majority of questions were about ethical concerns and responsibility issues.

 Avoid The Top 10 Mistakes Made By Beginning PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,553045191,"I've tested a myriad of ECG devices that patients can use at home. From Kardia to Viatom Checkme Pro, I've seen a range of hardware and app interfaces. As on the photo,  AliveCor Inc.  obviously stands out. Whenever I mention such technologies in my talks, I get colleagues asking me why a patient would record an ECG at home. I keep on telling them that identifying arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation can be life-saving and that we cannot wait to get checked once every few years at the point-of-care. We want to be the point-of-care. And then this comprehensive study comes out: Screening for Atrial Fibrillation and the Role of Digital Health Technologies It really covers every issue around the subject. It doesn't promote digital health blindly but concludes that while such devices might be used to increase the ease and specificity of screening for AF compared to traditional methods, it still requires further studies.

 What Can You Do To Save Your POLITICS From Destruction By Social Media?,politics,681583983,"I published this infographic last week and recevied excellent feedback from you. Many thanks for that!  A bit of a context: it's not surprising that by September in 2019, there are already more medical studies mentioning machine or deep learning than in 2018.  It was also expected that oncology, pathology and radiology stand out when it comes to using A.I. methods in medicine. However, I was surprised to see so many studies in psychiatry, surgery and neurology while you don't see discussions, news and announcements about those developments often. At the same time, it seems that cardiology, ophthalmology and dermatology, the specialties with the most exciting news and developments seem to be underrepresented.

 Marriage And SCIENCE Have More In Common Than You Think,science,438361431,"It was really hard to track down the developers of Leela Chess Zero, the highest rated chess engine today, but I managed to find them in a developer forum. It was interesting to learn that the developers are not professional chess players and they don't even need to be to develop such an algorithm.  Imagine the same in medicine. Developers creating the highest rated medical algorithm without having a profound knowledge of medicine. This is the era artificial intelligence is bringing to us. Here is how they described the algorithm works: ""Leela Chess uses a neural network trained without human knowledge. The training procedure uses reinforcement learning to train the next generation of the network based on games played using the previous one against itself (“self-play”) so without any external influence. The initial network is trained using random games so there is no human input in the process. The next network improvement comes from using a (small) search tree to improve the neural network’s evaluation of a position and using this outcome, together with the game result, to train the next network. Any principles used during play are discovered this way, but not in a way that can be easily extracted as such. Obviously, the rules of chess are hard-coded in the engine.""

Loud snoring ruins the lives of millions: the snorers’ as well as that of those who have to listen to it frequently. However, snoring isn’t just an annoyance. It can hint at a serious sleeping disorder: sleep apnea. Not only does the condition cause frustration in itself, but when looking at the comfort of it, its treatment could be compared to an attack of Aliens.  How could digital health help patients who undergo sleep apnea treatment?

In my case, I have high risk for three conditions (coronary heart disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). I've seen these in other genetic tests before but my high melanoma risk was not included in the report as they don't check for polymorphisms in cancer. The ""average risk"" conditions I have are quite common across populations.  Regarding hereditary diseases, I don't carry any of the about 200 conditions they check for. It doesn't mean it's a 100% I don't carry those gene variants but there is a big chance for that. To check for a specific condition, I'd need a more detailed genetic test.

 5 Ways Of HR MANAGEMENT That Can Drive You Bankrupt - Fast!,HR management,538336661,"What do you wish you knew before starting your career? I just finished Confessions of a public speaker, a book every speaker should read. I stopped keeping track of how many presentations and keynotes I have given after 500. The book made me think about the one thing that I would have loved to know before even giving a speech. The example I saw back then was that you make a breakthrough (in science, in business, or by publishing a great book, etc.) and then you can ride that wave for many years. I've seen good speakers give the same talk many times. The truth is that in the 21st century it doesn't work.

Along these lines, my new keynote narrative entirely dedicated to artificial intelligence in medicine comes out this September.

 Who Else Wants To Know The Mystery Behind PAINTING?,painting,985574286,"Clinical trials today are long and expensive. Pharma companies spend billions of dollars and still, at the end of the day a drug might not become approved. On the one hand, this creates a huge risk for them to invest into innovation, on the other hand patients sometimes have to wait for unnecessarily long until a new drug reaches the market. Moreover, we live in an era when we test new drugs on patients.  In silico clinical trials aided by artificial narrow intelligence have the promise to change this by using less time, money and human resources.

 Get The Most Out of GST and Facebook,GST,558493679,"If senators don’t understand Facebook, how will they regulate digital health issues? – I asked last year.  http://bit.ly/2XRTQ77 After yesterday’s Facebook Libra hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, I wonder whether Congress is savvy enough to understand Libra to the extent that it can coherently regulate it.  During Tuesday’s two-hours-long session, most of the lawmakers seemed far less concerned with the technology than with Facebook and the series of scandals (which should also be a key issue on the table) around the company in recent years.  Policy-makers must inevitably have a profound knowledge of new technologies so they can make the best decisions when it comes to regulating Libra or when considering complex ethical issues regarding the 3D printing of synthetic tissues, autonomous surgical robots or the use of artificial intelligence in diagnostics.

 15 Lessons About SCIENCE You Need To Learn To Succeed,science,556630675,"There’s an urgent need to lower the staggering levels of physician burnout around the globe as it results in reduced quality of life for the medical community, decreased levels of patient care – and a worsening human resources crisis in the long run.  While technology, especially EHRs, is often considered as an essential factor contributing to physician burnout, we expect artificial intelligence to significantly reduce the administrative burden and improve medical professionals’ work experience in the future. I think that such repetitive, monotonous tasks without the slightest need for creativity could and should be done by artificial intelligence in the future.  #humanresources   #artificialintelligence   #innovation   #business   #technology   #education   #science   #psychology   #healthcare   #tech   #thefuture   #mentalhealth   #community

 5 Sexy Ways To Improve Your MATHEMATICS,Mathematics,264419310,"The essence of digital health from a recent paper of The Medical Futurist Institute: ""Through the cultural transformation called digital health, the hierarchy of traditional medicine is transforming into an equal-level partnership between patients and caregivers. Besides many disruptive technologies, AI has the biggest potential to support this transition by analyzing the vast amounts of data patients and healthcare institutions record in every moment.  By taking away the repetitive parts of a physician’s job, it might lead to being able to spend more precious time with their patients, improving the human touch. However, AI can only fulfill its mission if it remains a safe, efficient, and proven aid in treating patients and improving healthcare."" https://lnkd.in/gRGWDxt #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #TMFI   #research

The two models keep trying to beat each other and after many iterations, the painter creates images indistinguishable from a real Picasso. This was the goal of the whole GAN.

In the case of HeadXNet, the researchers focused on its ability to identify the presence aneurysms rather than on detecting their absence. As a result, HeadXNet improved clinicians’ ability to see aneurysm but didn’t affect their ability to identify scans without them.""

 3 Simple Tips For Using ART To Get Ahead Your Competition,art,272639903,"Yesterday, I gave a keynote about artificial intelligence's role in healthcare to a biopharma company. One of the best questions I received was about liability. Who is to blame if an A.I. algorithm makes a mistake? This is a recurring issue and I like to answer it with a metaphor. If a physician listens to your heart sounds with a stethoscope and there was something wrong with the device and it misled the diagnosis, who is to blame? The manufacturer of the stethoscope? Never. The physician is supposed to be using all the available technologies at their disposal and with their expertise and knowledge therefore only they can be blamed, the final decision is their responsibility.  The same applies to the use of A.I. It is a (regulated, supervised and assessed) tool in the physician's hand and thus only contributes to the decisions, not making them.

 5 Ways You Can Get More PAINTING While Spending Less,painting,483884911,"Moravec paradox represents a super exciting issue in the world of artificial intelligence. It basically says that high-level reasoning requires much less computation than low-level sensorimotor skills. In short, it's easier to write a program to be the CEO of a major company than to be a coal miner.  As Hans Moravec writes, ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"". Regarding the A.I. era of medicine, it might mean that it makes more sense to teach an algorithm to get better at certain skills important for us working in healthcare than expect programmers to write a code that can do it right away. Meaning we have to be very patient with algorithm when they come to medicine. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #TMFchessjourney

 Should Fixing POLITICAL Take 60 Steps?,political,913284309,"Very promising papers come out every day about machine and deep learning algorithms used for medical and healthcare purposes and this field is just blowing up. I received questions from physician colleagues who are not A.I. experts about how they should evaluate these papers. I thought I would share a few things I do myself. - It matters where the paper is published. It's not scientific elitism but it matters if a new algorithm gets presented in Nature Medicine or in a third level journal. - Look for the Methods section where they describe where they got the data. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data. Some groups just use a good dataset and do tricks on it to make it bigger (e.g. invert images to double the database size). That's not the same as getting a huge amount of annotated data. - Look for the clinical collaboration they had. If an algorithm works well on a pre-selected dataset, that sounds fine. But when it works on clinical datasets too, that is the one we are looking for. When I saw @ DeepMind  collaborating closely with the NHS, I knew that was the right direction. Can you please share the tricks you use while assessing a medical A.I. paper? #digitalhealth   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #TMFchessjourney

 World Class Tools Make PROGRAMMING Push Button Easy,programming,620560167,"The question about A.I. is never technology vs humans. GM Garry Kasparov introduced the concept of advanced chess, also known as cyborg or centaur chess. He wanted to bring together human and computer skills to achieve the following results: - increasing the level of play to heights never before seen in chess; - producing blunder-free games with the qualities and the beauty of both perfect tactical play and highly meaningful strategic plans; - offering the public an overview of the mental processes of strong human chess players and powerful chess computers, and the combination of their forces. The most exciting medical studies that used machine or deep learning did not conclude that algorithms are better than physicians at doing a specific task but those that showed how the combination of computational and human cognition leads to the best results.  My favorite studies in this are the ones with detecting breast cancer on slides and diabetic retinopathy on retinal images. Excellent results underscoring the notion that artificial narrow intelligence will work with medical professionals and vice versa for the best results.

 Using 7 OPERATING SYSTEM Strategies Like The Pros,operating system,228443914,"Digital health is a cultural transformation. That’s a key message I regularly address in my keynotes and also a basis of The Medical Futurist Institute’s research on the paradigm shift currently taking place in healthcare. Let me demonstrate it through an example.  Brennan Spiegel, MD, MSHS  and the VR clinical research team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have been doing a tremendous job assessing the health benefits of virtual reality. They have been experimenting with the technology for several years and found a significant drop in pain scores in case of VR therapies. What strikes me in their story is that the immersive,  multi-sensory environments had a more significant impact on patients when medical professionals participated in the therapy as a guide, introducing the technology gradually and coaching the patient along the session. VR is an area of endless possibilities, but it can demonstrate it’s real effect when it’s combined with the human touch, medical professionals taking up the role of guiding their patients through digital health technologies. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #speaker   #keynote   #speakerlife

 3 Mistakes In MATHEMATICS That Make You Look Dumb,Mathematics,609504573,"So I've been progresing in chess studying openings and exercising 2-3 hours every day. I'm around 1400 ELO on  chess.com  (an increase of 600 points since November). I learn so much about how A.I. will be used in medicine on the way. Rudolf Spielmann said that in chess, """"Play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine.” There is a huge overlap with how we practice medicine.  The opening is obtaining data and information about patients. It should be done like reading a book. Seamless and by the rules. The middle game is the hard part: making a diagnosis. It is even currently being done like magicians do their job. A lot of people don't understand it but it's fascinating, hard and creative.  The endgame is the therapy and monitoring part which should work like a machine: automated following guidelines. This is only possible by implementing artificial narrow intelligence into the daily work of medical professionals. This is why it's so important to understand the basics of A.I.

Everyone seems to be building artificial intelligence-based software, also in healthcare, but no one talks about one of the most important aspects of the work: data annotation and the people behind it.  That’s the point when we need a deep dive into context: How do you create a smart algorithm? Where and how do you get the data for it? What do you need for a pattern recognizing program to work well and what are the challenges?  Why context matters? It is about asking a lot of questions to show why a particular piece of information, event, technology is important, how these things can provide a way to understand the world. With The Medical Futurist team we help healthcare stakeholders contextualize where they stand in the stream of new trends. So back to the main question, one of the biggest obstacles for AI adoption is the lack of labeled data.

 Why Most People Will Never Be Great At FASHION DESIGN,Fashion Design,741637279,"On my A.I. journey, I just had a workshop with a developer who works with deep and machine learning algorithms. I had a hundred questions and he helped me understand the details of not just these methods but also their implications for medicine and healthcare.  What stroke me the most was what I learnt about reinforcement learning. AlphaGo that beat the world's best GO player (Lee Sedol, on the photo) also used that. It means you describe rules and then let the algorithm get outputs. Then you retrospectively tell the algorithm which output was fine and it creates its own rules for reaching those outputs. Do you know what it means?  It means it's not bound the cognitive limitation of people. Physicians have been accusing me that I want to take away their ""art of practicing medicine"". I now go further than that. The era of medicine being an art will just begin when reinforcement learning tackles medical tasks. Can you imagine what new ways we will learn about finding cures, treatments and managing conditions? Ways we have never thought of.

As I dive deeper and deeper into these topics, I'll keep on sharing all the experiences, details and questions that arise.  I hope you will follow me on my journey as artificial intelligence is the biggest threat as well as the biggest opportunity for humanity's progress, especially in healthcare. Digital health technologies will only make patients the point-of-care with proper, accurate and safe A.I. #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #TMFchessjourney

It describes why science fiction helps prepare for the future and what kind of daily habit can help determine what desired futures we choose.  Even people who are not sci-fi fans realize how amazing the way science fiction authors think about the utopias and dystopias.

The video shows a 72y old female with a right parasagittal meningioma before a neurosurgery procedure. Using Microsoft HoloLens, the surgeon is able to see a patient-specific 3D model based on the pre-operative MRI, placed with accuracy inside of the patient: in yellow the brain cortex, in green the meningioma and in blue and red the two spino-thalamic tracts. This offers more information to the surgeon, who can better decide the position of the patient for the procedure and the correct approach for the craniotomy and the reaching of the tumor.  https://lnkd.in/gXpfnCG

 The Single Most Important Thing You Need To Know About PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,277515433,"I ordered steak. The menu item blinked in red twice in my digital lens but I didn’t care. I was very hungry and I love meat. Since it became possible to merge our genomic data with health records in the cloud synchronized with each and every digital device, choosing food has turned into a stressful activity. They wanted to tell me what and when to eat and it has made me crazy. They knew better what me and especially my body needed. My grandfather told me that back in the day nobody knew what the hell you were eating. You just went to a restaurant, ordered and finished your meal. Simple as that. I know they died from a lot of diseases without any foreseeable signs but still. That freedom of choice is special. I don’t even understand why we bother to eat at all today. Just choose whatever is tailored to me and bring it in a powder or something. It’s not worth the effort when it’s so expensive to eat less healthy foods or choose what is out of my metabolic bounds. Sometimes I wish I were in the old ages with infections, sudden deaths, and short lifespans. But man, going out to eat whatever you want must have been a hell of an experience. I get back to my steak, which is obviously artificial but might taste like those dishes my grandfather talked about.

I snapped the picture, uploaded it to her cloud and she responded in a second: ""You have a sore throat and let's make sure it will go away as smoothly as possible.""  She told me what to have for breakfast, what kind of tea to make and what over-the-counter drug to start with. She also told me she would monitor my vital signs through my skin patch and will let me know if I need antibiotics. I asked her how much time it would take to get better and whether I can work today. She responded with empathy and encouragement sharing the conclusions of analyzing millions of patient journeys with the same issue: ""We will take care of it together, don't worry. You are in good hands."" After a few days of guidance and suggestions, she made me get better sooner than expected. At not one point I felt alone with my problems.

 What Alberto Savoia Can Teach You About OPERATING SYSTEM,operating system,413138481,"I remember watching Hank Aaron break Babe Ruth's home run record on television with my grandfather when I was four years old. It was my first realization of racism as my grandpa explained that Aaron was the best athlete alive, in his opinion, but that he wasn't treated as such by many because he was black. It made no sense to me, a child who was growing up in rural, predominantly white Minnesota but I knew what Aaron had done was a very big deal, by my grandfather's reaction. Bigger than being the best baseball player alive. I am grateful to Henry Louis Aaron for combating racism and changing hearts and minds with his talent and grateful to my grandfather for having a conversation with me that too many  parents or grandparents would likely avoid having with a four year old.  #perseverance   #champion

 The Secret of Successful GST,GST,566837186,"I will never forget September 11, 2001. I won't forget the shock of watching two airplanes fly into the world trade center and the horror of those towers tumbling to the ground, knowing there were precious lives being lost, 2977 to be exact and thousands more injured. I also won't forget how united we felt as a nation as I saw American flags on cars, homes and businesses. The way we looked at one another even though we may have been strangers, and showed shared grief in a glance. We felt sorrow and fear together and we were united in fiercely defending our nation, our freedom, from anyone who dare attack it.  I have thought a great deal about that today and how divided we are now. I wonder what the date will be that we will memorialize in future years as the final day an American died of Covid 19. I wish we were attacking this adversary as a united front and coming together rather than it pulling us apart. Where is our empathy for those among us who are physically at risk, where is our sense of duty to protect our neighbor and other members of our community? Where is our ability to understand there is much we still don't know and not knowing is not dependent on our party affiliation. I will never forget what we lost on 9/11 or who we are capable of being.   #america   #compassion

 3 Tips About BANKING You Can't Afford To Miss,banking,170911070,"Attention employers and benefits managers! I am a caregiver and just spent the past 2 hours on the telephone with Medicare and a supplemental insurance company (starts with an M ends with a A) because said insurance company didn't disenroll my mother when she moved to another state 4 months ago. I called to let them know of the move when it occurred as well as notifying Medicare and SSA. Now her doctor is unable to see her unless she pays out of her own pocket because this supplemental plan is an obstacle and preventing her from getting the new plan in her new state. Her medication is necessary to prevent her from having additional strokes. I can't put this off or deal with it tomorrow. Employers, this is an example of what up to 60% of your workforce is dealing with that is impacting engagement and productivity. This is why you need to offer solutions to support working caregivers now. Covid 19 has made caregiving at least 50% more challenging. Contact me, I can quickly help you implement a plan to support working caregivers.  #employeebenefits   #workingcaregivers

 Top 10 Tips With GRAPHIC,graphic,931040371,"I've been thinking a lot lately about things I can do to be more present and connected to community and small ways to make a real difference. I started a list and thought I would share and ask for additional ideas. Please share yours! Take a co-worker you don't know well to lunch and get to know them better. Bring a plate of cookies or bowl of fruit to a neighbor. Start an office or neighborhood coat drive and donate winter coats to a local homeless shelter. Volunteer to listen to kids read at a local school. Let someone go ahead of you in line, just because. Put treats out for neighbors who walk their dogs. Explore a part of town you typically don't visit to shop, go to a play or musical event. Share your talent by volunteering some time to teaching even one person how to play an instrument, paint, draw, sing or act. Do handyman/woman jobs for a neighbor. Mow or take a lawn or shovel a walk for someone who needs help doing it. Organize a trash pickup day at a local park, beach, creek side... Give someone a compliment each day. Start a cooking club and take turns hosting dinner for friends. Invite a guest. Look at the checkout clerk when they say ""hello"" and ask you how your day is going. Ask them how their day is going too. Listen to their answer and be present.

 Take 10 Minutes to Get Started With ART,art,96666523,"It was a pleasure visiting the Hospices De Beaune in the Burgundy region of France today.  The story of Chancellor Nicolas Rolin who in 1443 built a beautiful place to care for the poor and sick at no charge really struck me.  He didn't cut corners and great thought went into creating a beautiful, compassionate environment for healing.  Wealthier patients did pay a small fee and had more private accommodations. Many also freely donated. The church and King Louis also provided funds and nuns cared for the sick. Those funds insured that everyone received care. Nuns even made fresh bread every morning to give to the townspeople who were suffering after the hundred year war. Wine from grapes in the vineyard were sold to fund the hospital.  To this day it is a symbol of great pride and compassion in the region.   Care and compassion to those who are suffering in a community makes the entire community stronger and more peaceful. People who show up and support one another thrive.  What would happen if in America there were smaller, regional models of care like this? Could communities create and find ways to fund care for everyone rich or poor?  Would someone be willing to manage it without receiving a seven figure salary?   #entrepeneurship   #healthcare   #business   #community

It's not selling coffee or shoes or even groceries. It sells healthcare coverage. Since it is a healthcare insurance company the expenses paid out are largely the healthcare costs of it's members. The incentive is tied to keeping those costs low so the company makes higher profits and the CEO is rewarded. Consider this when the insurance companies are complaining about how much it costs them to cover those of us with pre-existing conditions.  Just a little food for thought.

 10 Ways To Immediately Start Selling PHOTOGRAPHY,photography,641978744,"Is ""free"" really free when it comes to social media platforms or other web or app based consumer products? My answer is a resounding ""no"" but I am not sure everyone sees it that way.  When creating alska and coming up with a pricing structure we were met with skepticism when saying we would charge customers a monthly fee of $8.99.  Some said ""Consumers won't pay when there are so many free products.""  Many said we should make it free to the consumer and generate revenue by selling data or advertising.  I thought it would be important for users to know that their information is protected and they wouldn't be inundated by advertisements for products or other services that may or may not be reputable.  Even when I look at competitors who claim to offer a solution to caregivers, I quickly see that they are mining data right from the initial attempt to register an account.  This turns me off immediately and I assume my customers would have the same reaction but, maybe not. Facebook still states on their registration page ""it's free and always will be.""  There are rumors that may change, what do you think?

 How To Start A Business With DANCE,dance,593082115,"As millions in the US and around the world take to the streets to demand an end to racism and racial injustice against black people in the wake of George Floyd’s brutal killing in Minneapolis, I am reminded of an encounter I learned a lot from more than 50 years ago. In 1967, I was 17 years old and had just launched Student Magazine to protest against the Vietnam War and other issues where I felt young people’s voices were not being heard. I was fortunate to get the rare chance to listen to James Baldwin, the brilliant African American writer and leading public intellectual. I had heard he was staying in London for a few days, so I went to his hotel and managed to secure an interview in his room. The conversation we had feels more present than ever during these days of protest.   “White people do not listen and do not care,” he said at one point, voicing his frustration at the continuing oppression of black people. “What would happen if they did listen?” I asked. “It isn’t me that they have to listen to,” he replied. “It isn’t any black man they have to listen to. It’s their own hearts and conscience.”  https://virg.in/psX
